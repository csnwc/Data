the
family
of
dashwood
had
long
been
settled
in
sussex
their
estate
was
large
and
their
residence
was
at
norland
park
in
the
centre
of
their
property
where
for
many
generations
they
had
lived
in
so
respectable
a
manner
as
to
engage
the
general
good
opinion
of
their
surrounding
acquaintance
the
late
owner
of
this
estate
was
a
single
man
who
lived
to
a
very
advanced
age
and
who
for
many
years
of
his
life
had
a
constant
companion
and
housekeeper
in
his
sister
but
her
death
which
happened
ten
years
before
his
own
produced
a
great
alteration
in
his
home
for
to
supply
her
loss
he
invited
and
received
into
his
house
the
family
of
his
nephew
mr
henry
dashwood
the
legal
inheritor
of
the
norland
estate
and
the
person
to
whom
he
intended
to
bequeath
it
in
the
society
of
his
nephew
and
niece
and
their
children
the
old
gentleman
s
days
were
comfortably
spent
his
attachment
to
them
all
increased
the
constant
attention
of
mr
and
mrs
henry
dashwood
to
his
wishes
which
proceeded
not
merely
from
interest
but
from
goodness
of
heart
gave
him
every
degree
of
solid
comfort
which
his
age
could
receive
and
the
cheerfulness
of
the
children
added
a
relish
to
his
existence
by
a
former
marriage
mr
henry
dashwood
had
one
son
by
his
present
lady
three
daughters
the
son
a
steady
respectable
young
man
was
amply
provided
for
by
the
fortune
of
his
mother
which
had
been
large
and
half
of
which
devolved
on
him
on
his
coming
of
age
by
his
own
marriage
likewise
which
happened
soon
afterwards
he
added
to
his
wealth
to
him
therefore
the
succession
to
the
norland
estate
was
not
so
really
important
as
to
his
sisters
for
their
fortune
independent
of
what
might
arise
to
them
from
their
father
s
inheriting
that
property
could
be
but
small
their
mother
had
nothing
and
their
father
only
seven
thousand
pounds
in
his
own
disposal
for
the
remaining
moiety
of
his
first
wife
s
fortune
was
also
secured
to
her
child
and
he
had
only
a
life
interest
in
it
the
old
gentleman
died
his
will
was
read
and
like
almost
every
other
will
gave
as
much
disappointment
as
pleasure
he
was
neither
so
unjust
nor
so
ungrateful
as
to
leave
his
estate
from
his
nephew
but
he
left
it
to
him
on
such
terms
as
destroyed
half
the
value
of
the
bequest
mr
dashwood
had
wished
for
it
more
for
the
sake
of
his
wife
and
daughters
than
for
himself
or
his
son
but
to
his
son
and
his
son
s
son
a
child
of
four
years
old
it
was
secured
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
to
himself
no
power
of
providing
for
those
who
were
most
dear
to
him
and
who
most
needed
a
provision
by
any
charge
on
the
estate
or
by
any
sale
of
its
valuable
woods
the
whole
was
tied
up
for
the
benefit
of
this
child
who
in
occasional
visits
with
his
father
and
mother
at
norland
had
so
far
gained
on
the
affections
of
his
uncle
by
such
attractions
as
are
by
no
means
unusual
in
children
of
two
or
three
years
old
an
imperfect
articulation
an
earnest
desire
of
having
his
own
way
many
cunning
tricks
and
a
great
deal
of
noise
as
to
outweigh
all
the
value
of
all
the
attention
which
for
years
he
had
received
from
his
niece
and
her
daughters
he
meant
not
to
be
unkind
however
and
as
a
mark
of
his
affection
for
the
three
girls
he
left
them
a
thousand
pounds
a
piece
mr
dashwood
s
disappointment
was
at
first
severe
but
his
temper
was
cheerful
and
sanguine
and
he
might
reasonably
hope
to
live
many
years
and
by
living
economically
lay
by
a
considerable
sum
from
the
produce
of
an
estate
already
large
and
capable
of
almost
immediate
improvement
but
the
fortune
which
had
been
so
tardy
in
coming
was
his
only
one
twelvemonth
he
survived
his
uncle
no
longer
and
ten
thousand
pounds
including
the
late
legacies
was
all
that
remained
for
his
widow
and
daughters
his
son
was
sent
for
as
soon
as
his
danger
was
known
and
to
him
mr
dashwood
recommended
with
all
the
strength
and
urgency
which
illness
could
command
the
interest
of
his
mother
in
law
and
sisters
mr
john
dashwood
had
not
the
strong
feelings
of
the
rest
of
the
family
but
he
was
affected
by
a
recommendation
of
such
a
nature
at
such
a
time
and
he
promised
to
do
every
thing
in
his
power
to
make
them
comfortable
his
father
was
rendered
easy
by
such
an
assurance
and
mr
john
dashwood
had
then
leisure
to
consider
how
much
there
might
prudently
be
in
his
power
to
do
for
them
he
was
not
an
ill
disposed
young
man
unless
to
be
rather
cold
hearted
and
rather
selfish
is
to
be
ill
disposed
but
he
was
in
general
well
respected
for
he
conducted
himself
with
propriety
in
the
discharge
of
his
ordinary
duties
had
he
married
a
more
amiable
woman
he
might
have
been
made
still
more
respectable
than
he
was
he
might
even
have
been
made
amiable
himself
for
he
was
very
young
when
he
married
and
very
fond
of
his
wife
but
mrs
john
dashwood
was
a
strong
caricature
of
himself
more
narrow
minded
and
selfish
when
he
gave
his
promise
to
his
father
he
meditated
within
himself
to
increase
the
fortunes
of
his
sisters
by
the
present
of
a
thousand
pounds
a
piece
he
then
really
thought
himself
equal
to
it
the
prospect
of
four
thousand
a
year
in
addition
to
his
present
income
besides
the
remaining
half
of
his
own
mother
s
fortune
warmed
his
heart
and
made
him
feel
capable
of
generosity
yes
he
would
give
them
three
thousand
pounds
it
would
be
liberal
and
handsome
it
would
be
enough
to
make
them
completely
easy
three
thousand
pounds
he
could
spare
so
considerable
a
sum
with
little
inconvenience
he
thought
of
it
all
day
long
and
for
many
days
successively
and
he
did
not
repent
no
sooner
was
his
father
s
funeral
over
than
mrs
john
dashwood
without
sending
any
notice
of
her
intention
to
her
mother
in
law
arrived
with
her
child
and
their
attendants
no
one
could
dispute
her
right
to
come
the
house
was
her
husband
s
from
the
moment
of
his
father
s
decease
but
the
indelicacy
of
her
conduct
was
so
much
the
greater
and
to
a
woman
in
mrs
dashwood
s
situation
with
only
common
feelings
must
have
been
highly
unpleasing
but
in
her
mind
there
was
a
sense
of
honor
so
keen
a
generosity
so
romantic
that
any
offence
of
the
kind
by
whomsoever
given
or
received
was
to
her
a
source
of
immovable
disgust
mrs
john
dashwood
had
never
been
a
favourite
with
any
of
her
husband
s
family
but
she
had
had
no
opportunity
till
the
present
of
shewing
them
with
how
little
attention
to
the
comfort
of
other
people
she
could
act
when
occasion
required
it
so
acutely
did
mrs
dashwood
feel
this
ungracious
behaviour
and
so
earnestly
did
she
despise
her
daughter
in
law
for
it
that
on
the
arrival
of
the
latter
she
would
have
quitted
the
house
for
ever
had
not
the
entreaty
of
her
eldest
girl
induced
her
first
to
reflect
on
the
propriety
of
going
and
her
own
tender
love
for
all
her
three
children
determined
her
afterwards
to
stay
and
for
their
sakes
avoid
a
breach
with
their
brother
elinor
this
eldest
daughter
whose
advice
was
so
effectual
possessed
a
strength
of
understanding
and
coolness
of
judgment
which
qualified
her
though
only
nineteen
to
be
the
counsellor
of
her
mother
and
enabled
her
frequently
to
counteract
to
the
advantage
of
them
all
that
eagerness
of
mind
in
mrs
dashwood
which
must
generally
have
led
to
imprudence
she
had
an
excellent
heart
her
disposition
was
affectionate
and
her
feelings
were
strong
but
she
knew
how
to
govern
them
it
was
a
knowledge
which
her
mother
had
yet
to
learn
and
which
one
of
her
sisters
had
resolved
never
to
be
taught
marianne
s
abilities
were
in
many
respects
quite
equal
to
elinor
s
she
was
sensible
and
clever
but
eager
in
everything
her
sorrows
her
joys
could
have
no
moderation
she
was
generous
amiable
interesting
she
was
everything
but
prudent
the
resemblance
between
her
and
her
mother
was
strikingly
great
elinor
saw
with
concern
the
excess
of
her
sister
s
sensibility
but
by
mrs
dashwood
it
was
valued
and
cherished
they
encouraged
each
other
now
in
the
violence
of
their
affliction
the
agony
of
grief
which
overpowered
them
at
first
was
voluntarily
renewed
was
sought
for
was
created
again
and
again
they
gave
themselves
up
wholly
to
their
sorrow
seeking
increase
of
wretchedness
in
every
reflection
that
could
afford
it
and
resolved
against
ever
admitting
consolation
in
future
elinor
too
was
deeply
afflicted
but
still
she
could
struggle
she
could
exert
herself
she
could
consult
with
her
brother
could
receive
her
sister
in
law
on
her
arrival
and
treat
her
with
proper
attention
and
could
strive
to
rouse
her
mother
to
similar
exertion
and
encourage
her
to
similar
forbearance
margaret
the
other
sister
was
a
good
humored
well
disposed
girl
but
as
she
had
already
imbibed
a
good
deal
of
marianne
s
romance
without
having
much
of
her
sense
she
did
not
at
thirteen
bid
fair
to
equal
her
sisters
at
a
more
advanced
period
of
life
mrs
john
dashwood
now
installed
herself
mistress
of
norland
and
her
mother
and
sisters
in
law
were
degraded
to
the
condition
of
visitors
as
such
however
they
were
treated
by
her
with
quiet
civility
and
by
her
husband
with
as
much
kindness
as
he
could
feel
towards
anybody
beyond
himself
his
wife
and
their
child
he
really
pressed
them
with
some
earnestness
to
consider
norland
as
their
home
and
as
no
plan
appeared
so
eligible
to
mrs
dashwood
as
remaining
there
till
she
could
accommodate
herself
with
a
house
in
the
neighbourhood
his
invitation
was
accepted
a
continuance
in
a
place
where
everything
reminded
her
of
former
delight
was
exactly
what
suited
her
mind
in
seasons
of
cheerfulness
no
temper
could
be
more
cheerful
than
hers
or
possess
in
a
greater
degree
that
sanguine
expectation
of
happiness
which
is
happiness
itself
but
in
sorrow
she
must
be
equally
carried
away
by
her
fancy
and
as
far
beyond
consolation
as
in
pleasure
she
was
beyond
alloy
mrs
john
dashwood
did
not
at
all
approve
of
what
her
husband
intended
to
do
for
his
sisters
to
take
three
thousand
pounds
from
the
fortune
of
their
dear
little
boy
would
be
impoverishing
him
to
the
most
dreadful
degree
she
begged
him
to
think
again
on
the
subject
how
could
he
answer
it
to
himself
to
rob
his
child
and
his
only
child
too
of
so
large
a
sum
and
what
possible
claim
could
the
miss
dashwoods
who
were
related
to
him
only
by
half
blood
which
she
considered
as
no
relationship
at
all
have
on
his
generosity
to
so
large
an
amount
it
was
very
well
known
that
no
affection
was
ever
supposed
to
exist
between
the
children
of
any
man
by
different
marriages
and
why
was
he
to
ruin
himself
and
their
poor
little
harry
by
giving
away
all
his
money
to
his
half
sisters
it
was
my
father
s
last
request
to
me
replied
her
husband
that
i
should
assist
his
widow
and
daughters
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
talking
of
i
dare
say
ten
to
one
but
he
was
light
headed
at
the
time
had
he
been
in
his
right
senses
he
could
not
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
begging
you
to
give
away
half
your
fortune
from
your
own
child
he
did
not
stipulate
for
any
particular
sum
my
dear
fanny
he
only
requested
me
in
general
terms
to
assist
them
and
make
their
situation
more
comfortable
than
it
was
in
his
power
to
do
perhaps
it
would
have
been
as
well
if
he
had
left
it
wholly
to
myself
he
could
hardly
suppose
i
should
neglect
them
but
as
he
required
the
promise
i
could
not
do
less
than
give
it
at
least
i
thought
so
at
the
time
the
promise
therefore
was
given
and
must
be
performed
something
must
be
done
for
them
whenever
they
leave
norland
and
settle
in
a
new
home
well
then
let
something
be
done
for
them
but
that
something
need
not
be
three
thousand
pounds
consider
she
added
that
when
the
money
is
once
parted
with
it
never
can
return
your
sisters
will
marry
and
it
will
be
gone
for
ever
if
indeed
it
could
be
restored
to
our
poor
little
boy
why
to
be
sure
said
her
husband
very
gravely
that
would
make
great
difference
the
time
may
come
when
harry
will
regret
that
so
large
a
sum
was
parted
with
if
he
should
have
a
numerous
family
for
instance
it
would
be
a
very
convenient
addition
to
be
sure
it
would
perhaps
then
it
would
be
better
for
all
parties
if
the
sum
were
diminished
one
half
five
hundred
pounds
would
be
a
prodigious
increase
to
their
fortunes
oh
beyond
anything
great
what
brother
on
earth
would
do
half
so
much
for
his
sisters
even
if
really
his
sisters
and
as
it
is
only
half
blood
but
you
have
such
a
generous
spirit
i
would
not
wish
to
do
any
thing
mean
he
replied
one
had
rather
on
such
occasions
do
too
much
than
too
little
no
one
at
least
can
think
i
have
not
done
enough
for
them
even
themselves
they
can
hardly
expect
more
there
is
no
knowing
what
they
may
expect
said
the
lady
but
we
are
not
to
think
of
their
expectations
the
question
is
what
you
can
afford
to
do
certainly
and
i
think
i
may
afford
to
give
them
five
hundred
pounds
a
piece
as
it
is
without
any
addition
of
mine
they
will
each
have
about
three
thousand
pounds
on
their
mother
s
death
a
very
comfortable
fortune
for
any
young
woman
to
be
sure
it
is
and
indeed
it
strikes
me
that
they
can
want
no
addition
at
all
they
will
have
ten
thousand
pounds
divided
amongst
them
if
they
marry
they
will
be
sure
of
doing
well
and
if
they
do
not
they
may
all
live
very
comfortably
together
on
the
interest
of
ten
thousand
pounds
that
is
very
true
and
therefore
i
do
not
know
whether
upon
the
whole
it
would
not
be
more
advisable
to
do
something
for
their
mother
while
she
lives
rather
than
for
them
something
of
the
annuity
kind
i
mean
my
sisters
would
feel
the
good
effects
of
it
as
well
as
herself
a
hundred
a
year
would
make
them
all
perfectly
comfortable
his
wife
hesitated
a
little
however
in
giving
her
consent
to
this
plan
to
be
sure
said
she
it
is
better
than
parting
with
fifteen
hundred
pounds
at
once
but
then
if
mrs
dashwood
should
live
fifteen
years
we
shall
be
completely
taken
in
fifteen
years
my
dear
fanny
her
life
cannot
be
worth
half
that
purchase
certainly
not
but
if
you
observe
people
always
live
for
ever
when
there
is
an
annuity
to
be
paid
them
and
she
is
very
stout
and
healthy
and
hardly
forty
an
annuity
is
a
very
serious
business
it
comes
over
and
over
every
year
and
there
is
no
getting
rid
of
it
you
are
not
aware
of
what
you
are
doing
i
have
known
a
great
deal
of
the
trouble
of
annuities
for
my
mother
was
clogged
with
the
payment
of
three
to
old
superannuated
servants
by
my
father
s
will
and
it
is
amazing
how
disagreeable
she
found
it
twice
every
year
these
annuities
were
to
be
paid
and
then
there
was
the
trouble
of
getting
it
to
them
and
then
one
of
them
was
said
to
have
died
and
afterwards
it
turned
out
to
be
no
such
thing
my
mother
was
quite
sick
of
it
her
income
was
not
her
own
she
said
with
such
perpetual
claims
on
it
and
it
was
the
more
unkind
in
my
father
because
otherwise
the
money
would
have
been
entirely
at
my
mother
s
disposal
without
any
restriction
whatever
it
has
given
me
such
an
abhorrence
of
annuities
that
i
am
sure
i
would
not
pin
myself
down
to
the
payment
of
one
for
all
the
world
it
is
certainly
an
unpleasant
thing
replied
mr
dashwood
to
have
those
kind
of
yearly
drains
on
one
s
income
one
s
fortune
as
your
mother
justly
says
is
not
one
s
own
to
be
tied
down
to
the
regular
payment
of
such
a
sum
on
every
rent
day
is
by
no
means
desirable
it
takes
away
one
s
independence
undoubtedly
and
after
all
you
have
no
thanks
for
it
they
think
themselves
secure
you
do
no
more
than
what
is
expected
and
it
raises
no
gratitude
at
all
if
i
were
you
whatever
i
did
should
be
done
at
my
own
discretion
entirely
i
would
not
bind
myself
to
allow
them
any
thing
yearly
it
may
be
very
inconvenient
some
years
to
spare
a
hundred
or
even
fifty
pounds
from
our
own
expenses
i
believe
you
are
right
my
love
it
will
be
better
that
there
should
be
no
annuity
in
the
case
whatever
i
may
give
them
occasionally
will
be
of
far
greater
assistance
than
a
yearly
allowance
because
they
would
only
enlarge
their
style
of
living
if
they
felt
sure
of
a
larger
income
and
would
not
be
sixpence
the
richer
for
it
at
the
end
of
the
year
it
will
certainly
be
much
the
best
way
a
present
of
fifty
pounds
now
and
then
will
prevent
their
ever
being
distressed
for
money
and
will
i
think
be
amply
discharging
my
promise
to
my
father
to
be
sure
it
will
indeed
to
say
the
truth
i
am
convinced
within
myself
that
your
father
had
no
idea
of
your
giving
them
any
money
at
all
the
assistance
he
thought
of
i
dare
say
was
only
such
as
might
be
reasonably
expected
of
you
for
instance
such
as
looking
out
for
a
comfortable
small
house
for
them
helping
them
to
move
their
things
and
sending
them
presents
of
fish
and
game
and
so
forth
whenever
they
are
in
season
i
ll
lay
my
life
that
he
meant
nothing
farther
indeed
it
would
be
very
strange
and
unreasonable
if
he
did
do
but
consider
my
dear
mr
dashwood
how
excessively
comfortable
your
mother
in
law
and
her
daughters
may
live
on
the
interest
of
seven
thousand
pounds
besides
the
thousand
pounds
belonging
to
each
of
the
girls
which
brings
them
in
fifty
pounds
a
year
a
piece
and
of
course
they
will
pay
their
mother
for
their
board
out
of
it
altogether
they
will
have
five
hundred
a
year
amongst
them
and
what
on
earth
can
four
women
want
for
more
than
that
they
will
live
so
cheap
their
housekeeping
will
be
nothing
at
all
they
will
have
no
carriage
no
horses
and
hardly
any
servants
they
will
keep
no
company
and
can
have
no
expenses
of
any
kind
only
conceive
how
comfortable
they
will
be
five
hundred
a
year
i
am
sure
i
cannot
imagine
how
they
will
spend
half
of
it
and
as
to
your
giving
them
more
it
is
quite
absurd
to
think
of
it
they
will
be
much
more
able
to
give
you
something
upon
my
word
said
mr
dashwood
i
believe
you
are
perfectly
right
my
father
certainly
could
mean
nothing
more
by
his
request
to
me
than
what
you
say
i
clearly
understand
it
now
and
i
will
strictly
fulfil
my
engagement
by
such
acts
of
assistance
and
kindness
to
them
as
you
have
described
when
my
mother
removes
into
another
house
my
services
shall
be
readily
given
to
accommodate
her
as
far
as
i
can
some
little
present
of
furniture
too
may
be
acceptable
then
certainly
returned
mrs
john
dashwood
but
however
one
thing
must
be
considered
when
your
father
and
mother
moved
to
norland
though
the
furniture
of
stanhill
was
sold
all
the
china
plate
and
linen
was
saved
and
is
now
left
to
your
mother
her
house
will
therefore
be
almost
completely
fitted
up
as
soon
as
she
takes
it
that
is
a
material
consideration
undoubtedly
a
valuable
legacy
indeed
and
yet
some
of
the
plate
would
have
been
a
very
pleasant
addition
to
our
own
stock
here
yes
and
the
set
of
breakfast
china
is
twice
as
handsome
as
what
belongs
to
this
house
a
great
deal
too
handsome
in
my
opinion
for
any
place
they
can
ever
afford
to
live
in
but
however
so
it
is
your
father
thought
only
of
them
and
i
must
say
this
that
you
owe
no
particular
gratitude
to
him
nor
attention
to
his
wishes
for
we
very
well
know
that
if
he
could
he
would
have
left
almost
everything
in
the
world
to
them
this
argument
was
irresistible
it
gave
to
his
intentions
whatever
of
decision
was
wanting
before
and
he
finally
resolved
that
it
would
be
absolutely
unnecessary
if
not
highly
indecorous
to
do
more
for
the
widow
and
children
of
his
father
than
such
kind
of
neighbourly
acts
as
his
own
wife
pointed
out
mrs
dashwood
remained
at
norland
several
months
not
from
any
disinclination
to
move
when
the
sight
of
every
well
known
spot
ceased
to
raise
the
violent
emotion
which
it
produced
for
a
while
for
when
her
spirits
began
to
revive
and
her
mind
became
capable
of
some
other
exertion
than
that
of
heightening
its
affliction
by
melancholy
remembrances
she
was
impatient
to
be
gone
and
indefatigable
in
her
inquiries
for
a
suitable
dwelling
in
the
neighbourhood
of
norland
for
to
remove
far
from
that
beloved
spot
was
impossible
but
she
could
hear
of
no
situation
that
at
once
answered
her
notions
of
comfort
and
ease
and
suited
the
prudence
of
her
eldest
daughter
whose
steadier
judgment
rejected
several
houses
as
too
large
for
their
income
which
her
mother
would
have
approved
mrs
dashwood
had
been
informed
by
her
husband
of
the
solemn
promise
on
the
part
of
his
son
in
their
favour
which
gave
comfort
to
his
last
earthly
reflections
she
doubted
the
sincerity
of
this
assurance
no
more
than
he
had
doubted
it
himself
and
she
thought
of
it
for
her
daughters
sake
with
satisfaction
though
as
for
herself
she
was
persuaded
that
a
much
smaller
provision
than
l
would
support
her
in
affluence
for
their
brother
s
sake
too
for
the
sake
of
his
own
heart
she
rejoiced
and
she
reproached
herself
for
being
unjust
to
his
merit
before
in
believing
him
incapable
of
generosity
his
attentive
behaviour
to
herself
and
his
sisters
convinced
her
that
their
welfare
was
dear
to
him
and
for
a
long
time
she
firmly
relied
on
the
liberality
of
his
intentions
the
contempt
which
she
had
very
early
in
their
acquaintance
felt
for
her
daughter
in
law
was
very
much
increased
by
the
farther
knowledge
of
her
character
which
half
a
year
s
residence
in
her
family
afforded
and
perhaps
in
spite
of
every
consideration
of
politeness
or
maternal
affection
on
the
side
of
the
former
the
two
ladies
might
have
found
it
impossible
to
have
lived
together
so
long
had
not
a
particular
circumstance
occurred
to
give
still
greater
eligibility
according
to
the
opinions
of
mrs
dashwood
to
her
daughters
continuance
at
norland
this
circumstance
was
a
growing
attachment
between
her
eldest
girl
and
the
brother
of
mrs
john
dashwood
a
gentleman
like
and
pleasing
young
man
who
was
introduced
to
their
acquaintance
soon
after
his
sister
s
establishment
at
norland
and
who
had
since
spent
the
greatest
part
of
his
time
there
some
mothers
might
have
encouraged
the
intimacy
from
motives
of
interest
for
edward
ferrars
was
the
eldest
son
of
a
man
who
had
died
very
rich
and
some
might
have
repressed
it
from
motives
of
prudence
for
except
a
trifling
sum
the
whole
of
his
fortune
depended
on
the
will
of
his
mother
but
mrs
dashwood
was
alike
uninfluenced
by
either
consideration
it
was
enough
for
her
that
he
appeared
to
be
amiable
that
he
loved
her
daughter
and
that
elinor
returned
the
partiality
it
was
contrary
to
every
doctrine
of
hers
that
difference
of
fortune
should
keep
any
couple
asunder
who
were
attracted
by
resemblance
of
disposition
and
that
elinor
s
merit
should
not
be
acknowledged
by
every
one
who
knew
her
was
to
her
comprehension
impossible
edward
ferrars
was
not
recommended
to
their
good
opinion
by
any
peculiar
graces
of
person
or
address
he
was
not
handsome
and
his
manners
required
intimacy
to
make
them
pleasing
he
was
too
diffident
to
do
justice
to
himself
but
when
his
natural
shyness
was
overcome
his
behaviour
gave
every
indication
of
an
open
affectionate
heart
his
understanding
was
good
and
his
education
had
given
it
solid
improvement
but
he
was
neither
fitted
by
abilities
nor
disposition
to
answer
the
wishes
of
his
mother
and
sister
who
longed
to
see
him
distinguished
as
they
hardly
knew
what
they
wanted
him
to
make
a
fine
figure
in
the
world
in
some
manner
or
other
his
mother
wished
to
interest
him
in
political
concerns
to
get
him
into
parliament
or
to
see
him
connected
with
some
of
the
great
men
of
the
day
mrs
john
dashwood
wished
it
likewise
but
in
the
mean
while
till
one
of
these
superior
blessings
could
be
attained
it
would
have
quieted
her
ambition
to
see
him
driving
a
barouche
but
edward
had
no
turn
for
great
men
or
barouches
all
his
wishes
centered
in
domestic
comfort
and
the
quiet
of
private
life
fortunately
he
had
a
younger
brother
who
was
more
promising
edward
had
been
staying
several
weeks
in
the
house
before
he
engaged
much
of
mrs
dashwood
s
attention
for
she
was
at
that
time
in
such
affliction
as
rendered
her
careless
of
surrounding
objects
she
saw
only
that
he
was
quiet
and
unobtrusive
and
she
liked
him
for
it
he
did
not
disturb
the
wretchedness
of
her
mind
by
ill
timed
conversation
she
was
first
called
to
observe
and
approve
him
farther
by
a
reflection
which
elinor
chanced
one
day
to
make
on
the
difference
between
him
and
his
sister
it
was
a
contrast
which
recommended
him
most
forcibly
to
her
mother
it
is
enough
said
she
to
say
that
he
is
unlike
fanny
is
enough
it
implies
everything
amiable
i
love
him
already
i
think
you
will
like
him
said
elinor
when
you
know
more
of
him
like
him
replied
her
mother
with
a
smile
i
feel
no
sentiment
of
approbation
inferior
to
love
you
may
esteem
him
i
have
never
yet
known
what
it
was
to
separate
esteem
and
love
mrs
dashwood
now
took
pains
to
get
acquainted
with
him
her
manners
were
attaching
and
soon
banished
his
reserve
she
speedily
comprehended
all
his
merits
the
persuasion
of
his
regard
for
elinor
perhaps
assisted
her
penetration
but
she
really
felt
assured
of
his
worth
and
even
that
quietness
of
manner
which
militated
against
all
her
established
ideas
of
what
a
young
man
s
address
ought
to
be
was
no
longer
uninteresting
when
she
knew
his
heart
to
be
warm
and
his
temper
affectionate
no
sooner
did
she
perceive
any
symptom
of
love
in
his
behaviour
to
elinor
than
she
considered
their
serious
attachment
as
certain
and
looked
forward
to
their
marriage
as
rapidly
approaching
in
a
few
months
my
dear
marianne
said
she
elinor
will
in
all
probability
be
settled
for
life
we
shall
miss
her
but
she
will
be
happy
oh
mama
how
shall
we
do
without
her
my
love
it
will
be
scarcely
a
separation
we
shall
live
within
a
few
miles
of
each
other
and
shall
meet
every
day
of
our
lives
you
will
gain
a
brother
a
real
affectionate
brother
i
have
the
highest
opinion
in
the
world
of
edward
s
heart
but
you
look
grave
marianne
do
you
disapprove
your
sister
s
choice
perhaps
said
marianne
i
may
consider
it
with
some
surprise
edward
is
very
amiable
and
i
love
him
tenderly
but
yet
he
is
not
the
kind
of
young
man
there
is
something
wanting
his
figure
is
not
striking
it
has
none
of
that
grace
which
i
should
expect
in
the
man
who
could
seriously
attach
my
sister
his
eyes
want
all
that
spirit
that
fire
which
at
once
announce
virtue
and
intelligence
and
besides
all
this
i
am
afraid
mama
he
has
no
real
taste
music
seems
scarcely
to
attract
him
and
though
he
admires
elinor
s
drawings
very
much
it
is
not
the
admiration
of
a
person
who
can
understand
their
worth
it
is
evident
in
spite
of
his
frequent
attention
to
her
while
she
draws
that
in
fact
he
knows
nothing
of
the
matter
he
admires
as
a
lover
not
as
a
connoisseur
to
satisfy
me
those
characters
must
be
united
i
could
not
be
happy
with
a
man
whose
taste
did
not
in
every
point
coincide
with
my
own
he
must
enter
into
all
my
feelings
the
same
books
the
same
music
must
charm
us
both
oh
mama
how
spiritless
how
tame
was
edward
s
manner
in
reading
to
us
last
night
i
felt
for
my
sister
most
severely
yet
she
bore
it
with
so
much
composure
she
seemed
scarcely
to
notice
it
i
could
hardly
keep
my
seat
to
hear
those
beautiful
lines
which
have
frequently
almost
driven
me
wild
pronounced
with
such
impenetrable
calmness
such
dreadful
indifference
he
would
certainly
have
done
more
justice
to
simple
and
elegant
prose
i
thought
so
at
the
time
but
you
would
give
him
cowper
nay
mama
if
he
is
not
to
be
animated
by
cowper
but
we
must
allow
for
difference
of
taste
elinor
has
not
my
feelings
and
therefore
she
may
overlook
it
and
be
happy
with
him
but
it
would
have
broke
my
heart
had
i
loved
him
to
hear
him
read
with
so
little
sensibility
mama
the
more
i
know
of
the
world
the
more
am
i
convinced
that
i
shall
never
see
a
man
whom
i
can
really
love
i
require
so
much
he
must
have
all
edward
s
virtues
and
his
person
and
manners
must
ornament
his
goodness
with
every
possible
charm
remember
my
love
that
you
are
not
seventeen
it
is
yet
too
early
in
life
to
despair
of
such
a
happiness
why
should
you
be
less
fortunate
than
your
mother
in
one
circumstance
only
my
marianne
may
your
destiny
be
different
from
hers
what
a
pity
it
is
elinor
said
marianne
that
edward
should
have
no
taste
for
drawing
no
taste
for
drawing
replied
elinor
why
should
you
think
so
he
does
not
draw
himself
indeed
but
he
has
great
pleasure
in
seeing
the
performances
of
other
people
and
i
assure
you
he
is
by
no
means
deficient
in
natural
taste
though
he
has
not
had
opportunities
of
improving
it
had
he
ever
been
in
the
way
of
learning
i
think
he
would
have
drawn
very
well
he
distrusts
his
own
judgment
in
such
matters
so
much
that
he
is
always
unwilling
to
give
his
opinion
on
any
picture
but
he
has
an
innate
propriety
and
simplicity
of
taste
which
in
general
direct
him
perfectly
right
marianne
was
afraid
of
offending
and
said
no
more
on
the
subject
but
the
kind
of
approbation
which
elinor
described
as
excited
in
him
by
the
drawings
of
other
people
was
very
far
from
that
rapturous
delight
which
in
her
opinion
could
alone
be
called
taste
yet
though
smiling
within
herself
at
the
mistake
she
honoured
her
sister
for
that
blind
partiality
to
edward
which
produced
it
i
hope
marianne
continued
elinor
you
do
not
consider
him
as
deficient
in
general
taste
indeed
i
think
i
may
say
that
you
cannot
for
your
behaviour
to
him
is
perfectly
cordial
and
if
that
were
your
opinion
i
am
sure
you
could
never
be
civil
to
him
marianne
hardly
knew
what
to
say
she
would
not
wound
the
feelings
of
her
sister
on
any
account
and
yet
to
say
what
she
did
not
believe
was
impossible
at
length
she
replied
do
not
be
offended
elinor
if
my
praise
of
him
is
not
in
every
thing
equal
to
your
sense
of
his
merits
i
have
not
had
so
many
opportunities
of
estimating
the
minuter
propensities
of
his
mind
his
inclinations
and
tastes
as
you
have
but
i
have
the
highest
opinion
in
the
world
of
his
goodness
and
sense
i
think
him
every
thing
that
is
worthy
and
amiable
i
am
sure
replied
elinor
with
a
smile
that
his
dearest
friends
could
not
be
dissatisfied
with
such
commendation
as
that
i
do
not
perceive
how
you
could
express
yourself
more
warmly
marianne
was
rejoiced
to
find
her
sister
so
easily
pleased
of
his
sense
and
his
goodness
continued
elinor
no
one
can
i
think
be
in
doubt
who
has
seen
him
often
enough
to
engage
him
in
unreserved
conversation
the
excellence
of
his
understanding
and
his
principles
can
be
concealed
only
by
that
shyness
which
too
often
keeps
him
silent
you
know
enough
of
him
to
do
justice
to
his
solid
worth
but
of
his
minuter
propensities
as
you
call
them
you
have
from
peculiar
circumstances
been
kept
more
ignorant
than
myself
he
and
i
have
been
at
times
thrown
a
good
deal
together
while
you
have
been
wholly
engrossed
on
the
most
affectionate
principle
by
my
mother
i
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
him
have
studied
his
sentiments
and
heard
his
opinion
on
subjects
of
literature
and
taste
and
upon
the
whole
i
venture
to
pronounce
that
his
mind
is
well
informed
enjoyment
of
books
exceedingly
great
his
imagination
lively
his
observation
just
and
correct
and
his
taste
delicate
and
pure
his
abilities
in
every
respect
improve
as
much
upon
acquaintance
as
his
manners
and
person
at
first
sight
his
address
is
certainly
not
striking
and
his
person
can
hardly
be
called
handsome
till
the
expression
of
his
eyes
which
are
uncommonly
good
and
the
general
sweetness
of
his
countenance
is
perceived
at
present
i
know
him
so
well
that
i
think
him
really
handsome
or
at
least
almost
so
what
say
you
marianne
i
shall
very
soon
think
him
handsome
elinor
if
i
do
not
now
when
you
tell
me
to
love
him
as
a
brother
i
shall
no
more
see
imperfection
in
his
face
than
i
now
do
in
his
heart
elinor
started
at
this
declaration
and
was
sorry
for
the
warmth
she
had
been
betrayed
into
in
speaking
of
him
she
felt
that
edward
stood
very
high
in
her
opinion
she
believed
the
regard
to
be
mutual
but
she
required
greater
certainty
of
it
to
make
marianne
s
conviction
of
their
attachment
agreeable
to
her
she
knew
that
what
marianne
and
her
mother
conjectured
one
moment
they
believed
the
next
that
with
them
to
wish
was
to
hope
and
to
hope
was
to
expect
she
tried
to
explain
the
real
state
of
the
case
to
her
sister
i
do
not
attempt
to
deny
said
she
that
i
think
very
highly
of
him
that
i
greatly
esteem
that
i
like
him
marianne
here
burst
forth
with
indignation
esteem
him
like
him
cold
hearted
elinor
oh
worse
than
cold
hearted
ashamed
of
being
otherwise
use
those
words
again
and
i
will
leave
the
room
this
moment
elinor
could
not
help
laughing
excuse
me
said
she
and
be
assured
that
i
meant
no
offence
to
you
by
speaking
in
so
quiet
a
way
of
my
own
feelings
believe
them
to
be
stronger
than
i
have
declared
believe
them
in
short
to
be
such
as
his
merit
and
the
suspicion
the
hope
of
his
affection
for
me
may
warrant
without
imprudence
or
folly
but
farther
than
this
you
must
not
believe
i
am
by
no
means
assured
of
his
regard
for
me
there
are
moments
when
the
extent
of
it
seems
doubtful
and
till
his
sentiments
are
fully
known
you
cannot
wonder
at
my
wishing
to
avoid
any
encouragement
of
my
own
partiality
by
believing
or
calling
it
more
than
it
is
in
my
heart
i
feel
little
scarcely
any
doubt
of
his
preference
but
there
are
other
points
to
be
considered
besides
his
inclination
he
is
very
far
from
being
independent
what
his
mother
really
is
we
cannot
know
but
from
fanny
s
occasional
mention
of
her
conduct
and
opinions
we
have
never
been
disposed
to
think
her
amiable
and
i
am
very
much
mistaken
if
edward
is
not
himself
aware
that
there
would
be
many
difficulties
in
his
way
if
he
were
to
wish
to
marry
a
woman
who
had
not
either
a
great
fortune
or
high
rank
marianne
was
astonished
to
find
how
much
the
imagination
of
her
mother
and
herself
had
outstripped
the
truth
and
you
really
are
not
engaged
to
him
said
she
yet
it
certainly
soon
will
happen
but
two
advantages
will
proceed
from
this
delay
i
shall
not
lose
you
so
soon
and
edward
will
have
greater
opportunity
of
improving
that
natural
taste
for
your
favourite
pursuit
which
must
be
so
indispensably
necessary
to
your
future
felicity
oh
if
he
should
be
so
far
stimulated
by
your
genius
as
to
learn
to
draw
himself
how
delightful
it
would
be
elinor
had
given
her
real
opinion
to
her
sister
she
could
not
consider
her
partiality
for
edward
in
so
prosperous
a
state
as
marianne
had
believed
it
there
was
at
times
a
want
of
spirits
about
him
which
if
it
did
not
denote
indifference
spoke
of
something
almost
as
unpromising
a
doubt
of
her
regard
supposing
him
to
feel
it
need
not
give
him
more
than
inquietude
it
would
not
be
likely
to
produce
that
dejection
of
mind
which
frequently
attended
him
a
more
reasonable
cause
might
be
found
in
the
dependent
situation
which
forbade
the
indulgence
of
his
affection
she
knew
that
his
mother
neither
behaved
to
him
so
as
to
make
his
home
comfortable
at
present
nor
to
give
him
any
assurance
that
he
might
form
a
home
for
himself
without
strictly
attending
to
her
views
for
his
aggrandizement
with
such
a
knowledge
as
this
it
was
impossible
for
elinor
to
feel
easy
on
the
subject
she
was
far
from
depending
on
that
result
of
his
preference
of
her
which
her
mother
and
sister
still
considered
as
certain
nay
the
longer
they
were
together
the
more
doubtful
seemed
the
nature
of
his
regard
and
sometimes
for
a
few
painful
minutes
she
believed
it
to
be
no
more
than
friendship
but
whatever
might
really
be
its
limits
it
was
enough
when
perceived
by
his
sister
to
make
her
uneasy
and
at
the
same
time
which
was
still
more
common
to
make
her
uncivil
she
took
the
first
opportunity
of
affronting
her
mother
in
law
on
the
occasion
talking
to
her
so
expressively
of
her
brother
s
great
expectations
of
mrs
ferrars
s
resolution
that
both
her
sons
should
marry
well
and
of
the
danger
attending
any
young
woman
who
attempted
to
draw
him
in
that
mrs
dashwood
could
neither
pretend
to
be
unconscious
nor
endeavor
to
be
calm
she
gave
her
an
answer
which
marked
her
contempt
and
instantly
left
the
room
resolving
that
whatever
might
be
the
inconvenience
or
expense
of
so
sudden
a
removal
her
beloved
elinor
should
not
be
exposed
another
week
to
such
insinuations
in
this
state
of
her
spirits
a
letter
was
delivered
to
her
from
the
post
which
contained
a
proposal
particularly
well
timed
it
was
the
offer
of
a
small
house
on
very
easy
terms
belonging
to
a
relation
of
her
own
a
gentleman
of
consequence
and
property
in
devonshire
the
letter
was
from
this
gentleman
himself
and
written
in
the
true
spirit
of
friendly
accommodation
he
understood
that
she
was
in
need
of
a
dwelling
and
though
the
house
he
now
offered
her
was
merely
a
cottage
he
assured
her
that
everything
should
be
done
to
it
which
she
might
think
necessary
if
the
situation
pleased
her
he
earnestly
pressed
her
after
giving
the
particulars
of
the
house
and
garden
to
come
with
her
daughters
to
barton
park
the
place
of
his
own
residence
from
whence
she
might
judge
herself
whether
barton
cottage
for
the
houses
were
in
the
same
parish
could
by
any
alteration
be
made
comfortable
to
her
he
seemed
really
anxious
to
accommodate
them
and
the
whole
of
his
letter
was
written
in
so
friendly
a
style
as
could
not
fail
of
giving
pleasure
to
his
cousin
more
especially
at
a
moment
when
she
was
suffering
under
the
cold
and
unfeeling
behaviour
of
her
nearer
connections
she
needed
no
time
for
deliberation
or
inquiry
her
resolution
was
formed
as
she
read
the
situation
of
barton
in
a
county
so
far
distant
from
sussex
as
devonshire
which
but
a
few
hours
before
would
have
been
a
sufficient
objection
to
outweigh
every
possible
advantage
belonging
to
the
place
was
now
its
first
recommendation
to
quit
the
neighbourhood
of
norland
was
no
longer
an
evil
it
was
an
object
of
desire
it
was
a
blessing
in
comparison
of
the
misery
of
continuing
her
daughter
in
law
s
guest
and
to
remove
for
ever
from
that
beloved
place
would
be
less
painful
than
to
inhabit
or
visit
it
while
such
a
woman
was
its
mistress
she
instantly
wrote
sir
john
middleton
her
acknowledgment
of
his
kindness
and
her
acceptance
of
his
proposal
and
then
hastened
to
shew
both
letters
to
her
daughters
that
she
might
be
secure
of
their
approbation
before
her
answer
were
sent
elinor
had
always
thought
it
would
be
more
prudent
for
them
to
settle
at
some
distance
from
norland
than
immediately
amongst
their
present
acquaintance
on
that
head
therefore
it
was
not
for
her
to
oppose
her
mother
s
intention
of
removing
into
devonshire
the
house
too
as
described
by
sir
john
was
on
so
simple
a
scale
and
the
rent
so
uncommonly
moderate
as
to
leave
her
no
right
of
objection
on
either
point
and
therefore
though
it
was
not
a
plan
which
brought
any
charm
to
her
fancy
though
it
was
a
removal
from
the
vicinity
of
norland
beyond
her
wishes
she
made
no
attempt
to
dissuade
her
mother
from
sending
a
letter
of
acquiescence
no
sooner
was
her
answer
dispatched
than
mrs
dashwood
indulged
herself
in
the
pleasure
of
announcing
to
her
son
in
law
and
his
wife
that
she
was
provided
with
a
house
and
should
incommode
them
no
longer
than
till
every
thing
were
ready
for
her
inhabiting
it
they
heard
her
with
surprise
mrs
john
dashwood
said
nothing
but
her
husband
civilly
hoped
that
she
would
not
be
settled
far
from
norland
she
had
great
satisfaction
in
replying
that
she
was
going
into
devonshire
edward
turned
hastily
towards
her
on
hearing
this
and
in
a
voice
of
surprise
and
concern
which
required
no
explanation
to
her
repeated
devonshire
are
you
indeed
going
there
so
far
from
hence
and
to
what
part
of
it
she
explained
the
situation
it
was
within
four
miles
northward
of
exeter
it
is
but
a
cottage
she
continued
but
i
hope
to
see
many
of
my
friends
in
it
a
room
or
two
can
easily
be
added
and
if
my
friends
find
no
difficulty
in
travelling
so
far
to
see
me
i
am
sure
i
will
find
none
in
accommodating
them
she
concluded
with
a
very
kind
invitation
to
mr
and
mrs
john
dashwood
to
visit
her
at
barton
and
to
edward
she
gave
one
with
still
greater
affection
though
her
late
conversation
with
her
daughter
in
law
had
made
her
resolve
on
remaining
at
norland
no
longer
than
was
unavoidable
it
had
not
produced
the
smallest
effect
on
her
in
that
point
to
which
it
principally
tended
to
separate
edward
and
elinor
was
as
far
from
being
her
object
as
ever
and
she
wished
to
show
mrs
john
dashwood
by
this
pointed
invitation
to
her
brother
how
totally
she
disregarded
her
disapprobation
of
the
match
mr
john
dashwood
told
his
mother
again
and
again
how
exceedingly
sorry
he
was
that
she
had
taken
a
house
at
such
a
distance
from
norland
as
to
prevent
his
being
of
any
service
to
her
in
removing
her
furniture
he
really
felt
conscientiously
vexed
on
the
occasion
for
the
very
exertion
to
which
he
had
limited
the
performance
of
his
promise
to
his
father
was
by
this
arrangement
rendered
impracticable
the
furniture
was
all
sent
around
by
water
it
chiefly
consisted
of
household
linen
plate
china
and
books
with
a
handsome
pianoforte
of
marianne
s
mrs
john
dashwood
saw
the
packages
depart
with
a
sigh
she
could
not
help
feeling
it
hard
that
as
mrs
dashwood
s
income
would
be
so
trifling
in
comparison
with
their
own
she
should
have
any
handsome
article
of
furniture
mrs
dashwood
took
the
house
for
a
twelvemonth
it
was
ready
furnished
and
she
might
have
immediate
possession
no
difficulty
arose
on
either
side
in
the
agreement
and
she
waited
only
for
the
disposal
of
her
effects
at
norland
and
to
determine
her
future
household
before
she
set
off
for
the
west
and
this
as
she
was
exceedingly
rapid
in
the
performance
of
everything
that
interested
her
was
soon
done
the
horses
which
were
left
her
by
her
husband
had
been
sold
soon
after
his
death
and
an
opportunity
now
offering
of
disposing
of
her
carriage
she
agreed
to
sell
that
likewise
at
the
earnest
advice
of
her
eldest
daughter
for
the
comfort
of
her
children
had
she
consulted
only
her
own
wishes
she
would
have
kept
it
but
the
discretion
of
elinor
prevailed
her
wisdom
too
limited
the
number
of
their
servants
to
three
two
maids
and
a
man
with
whom
they
were
speedily
provided
from
amongst
those
who
had
formed
their
establishment
at
norland
the
man
and
one
of
the
maids
were
sent
off
immediately
into
devonshire
to
prepare
the
house
for
their
mistress
s
arrival
for
as
lady
middleton
was
entirely
unknown
to
mrs
dashwood
she
preferred
going
directly
to
the
cottage
to
being
a
visitor
at
barton
park
and
she
relied
so
undoubtingly
on
sir
john
s
description
of
the
house
as
to
feel
no
curiosity
to
examine
it
herself
till
she
entered
it
as
her
own
her
eagerness
to
be
gone
from
norland
was
preserved
from
diminution
by
the
evident
satisfaction
of
her
daughter
in
law
in
the
prospect
of
her
removal
a
satisfaction
which
was
but
feebly
attempted
to
be
concealed
under
a
cold
invitation
to
her
to
defer
her
departure
now
was
the
time
when
her
son
in
law
s
promise
to
his
father
might
with
particular
propriety
be
fulfilled
since
he
had
neglected
to
do
it
on
first
coming
to
the
estate
their
quitting
his
house
might
be
looked
on
as
the
most
suitable
period
for
its
accomplishment
but
mrs
dashwood
began
shortly
to
give
over
every
hope
of
the
kind
and
to
be
convinced
from
the
general
drift
of
his
discourse
that
his
assistance
extended
no
farther
than
their
maintenance
for
six
months
at
norland
he
so
frequently
talked
of
the
increasing
expenses
of
housekeeping
and
of
the
perpetual
demands
upon
his
purse
which
a
man
of
any
consequence
in
the
world
was
beyond
calculation
exposed
to
that
he
seemed
rather
to
stand
in
need
of
more
money
himself
than
to
have
any
design
of
giving
money
away
in
a
very
few
weeks
from
the
day
which
brought
sir
john
middleton
s
first
letter
to
norland
every
thing
was
so
far
settled
in
their
future
abode
as
to
enable
mrs
dashwood
and
her
daughters
to
begin
their
journey
many
were
the
tears
shed
by
them
in
their
last
adieus
to
a
place
so
much
beloved
dear
dear
norland
said
marianne
as
she
wandered
alone
before
the
house
on
the
last
evening
of
their
being
there
when
shall
i
cease
to
regret
you
when
learn
to
feel
a
home
elsewhere
oh
happy
house
could
you
know
what
i
suffer
in
now
viewing
you
from
this
spot
from
whence
perhaps
i
may
view
you
no
more
and
you
ye
well
known
trees
but
you
will
continue
the
same
no
leaf
will
decay
because
we
are
removed
nor
any
branch
become
motionless
although
we
can
observe
you
no
longer
no
you
will
continue
the
same
unconscious
of
the
pleasure
or
the
regret
you
occasion
and
insensible
of
any
change
in
those
who
walk
under
your
shade
but
who
will
remain
to
enjoy
you
the
first
part
of
their
journey
was
performed
in
too
melancholy
a
disposition
to
be
otherwise
than
tedious
and
unpleasant
but
as
they
drew
towards
the
end
of
it
their
interest
in
the
appearance
of
a
country
which
they
were
to
inhabit
overcame
their
dejection
and
a
view
of
barton
valley
as
they
entered
it
gave
them
cheerfulness
it
was
a
pleasant
fertile
spot
well
wooded
and
rich
in
pasture
after
winding
along
it
for
more
than
a
mile
they
reached
their
own
house
a
small
green
court
was
the
whole
of
its
demesne
in
front
and
a
neat
wicket
gate
admitted
them
into
it
as
a
house
barton
cottage
though
small
was
comfortable
and
compact
but
as
a
cottage
it
was
defective
for
the
building
was
regular
the
roof
was
tiled
the
window
shutters
were
not
painted
green
nor
were
the
walls
covered
with
honeysuckles
a
narrow
passage
led
directly
through
the
house
into
the
garden
behind
on
each
side
of
the
entrance
was
a
sitting
room
about
sixteen
feet
square
and
beyond
them
were
the
offices
and
the
stairs
four
bed
rooms
and
two
garrets
formed
the
rest
of
the
house
it
had
not
been
built
many
years
and
was
in
good
repair
in
comparison
of
norland
it
was
poor
and
small
indeed
but
the
tears
which
recollection
called
forth
as
they
entered
the
house
were
soon
dried
away
they
were
cheered
by
the
joy
of
the
servants
on
their
arrival
and
each
for
the
sake
of
the
others
resolved
to
appear
happy
it
was
very
early
in
september
the
season
was
fine
and
from
first
seeing
the
place
under
the
advantage
of
good
weather
they
received
an
impression
in
its
favour
which
was
of
material
service
in
recommending
it
to
their
lasting
approbation
the
situation
of
the
house
was
good
high
hills
rose
immediately
behind
and
at
no
great
distance
on
each
side
some
of
which
were
open
downs
the
others
cultivated
and
woody
the
village
of
barton
was
chiefly
on
one
of
these
hills
and
formed
a
pleasant
view
from
the
cottage
windows
the
prospect
in
front
was
more
extensive
it
commanded
the
whole
of
the
valley
and
reached
into
the
country
beyond
the
hills
which
surrounded
the
cottage
terminated
the
valley
in
that
direction
under
another
name
and
in
another
course
it
branched
out
again
between
two
of
the
steepest
of
them
with
the
size
and
furniture
of
the
house
mrs
dashwood
was
upon
the
whole
well
satisfied
for
though
her
former
style
of
life
rendered
many
additions
to
the
latter
indispensable
yet
to
add
and
improve
was
a
delight
to
her
and
she
had
at
this
time
ready
money
enough
to
supply
all
that
was
wanted
of
greater
elegance
to
the
apartments
as
for
the
house
itself
to
be
sure
said
she
it
is
too
small
for
our
family
but
we
will
make
ourselves
tolerably
comfortable
for
the
present
as
it
is
too
late
in
the
year
for
improvements
perhaps
in
the
spring
if
i
have
plenty
of
money
as
i
dare
say
i
shall
we
may
think
about
building
these
parlors
are
both
too
small
for
such
parties
of
our
friends
as
i
hope
to
see
often
collected
here
and
i
have
some
thoughts
of
throwing
the
passage
into
one
of
them
with
perhaps
a
part
of
the
other
and
so
leave
the
remainder
of
that
other
for
an
entrance
this
with
a
new
drawing
room
which
may
be
easily
added
and
a
bed
chamber
and
garret
above
will
make
it
a
very
snug
little
cottage
i
could
wish
the
stairs
were
handsome
but
one
must
not
expect
every
thing
though
i
suppose
it
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
widen
them
i
shall
see
how
much
i
am
before
hand
with
the
world
in
the
spring
and
we
will
plan
our
improvements
accordingly
in
the
mean
time
till
all
these
alterations
could
be
made
from
the
savings
of
an
income
of
five
hundred
a
year
by
a
woman
who
never
saved
in
her
life
they
were
wise
enough
to
be
contented
with
the
house
as
it
was
and
each
of
them
was
busy
in
arranging
their
particular
concerns
and
endeavoring
by
placing
around
them
books
and
other
possessions
to
form
themselves
a
home
marianne
s
pianoforte
was
unpacked
and
properly
disposed
of
and
elinor
s
drawings
were
affixed
to
the
walls
of
their
sitting
room
in
such
employments
as
these
they
were
interrupted
soon
after
breakfast
the
next
day
by
the
entrance
of
their
landlord
who
called
to
welcome
them
to
barton
and
to
offer
them
every
accommodation
from
his
own
house
and
garden
in
which
theirs
might
at
present
be
deficient
sir
john
middleton
was
a
good
looking
man
about
forty
he
had
formerly
visited
at
stanhill
but
it
was
too
long
for
his
young
cousins
to
remember
him
his
countenance
was
thoroughly
good
humoured
and
his
manners
were
as
friendly
as
the
style
of
his
letter
their
arrival
seemed
to
afford
him
real
satisfaction
and
their
comfort
to
be
an
object
of
real
solicitude
to
him
he
said
much
of
his
earnest
desire
of
their
living
in
the
most
sociable
terms
with
his
family
and
pressed
them
so
cordially
to
dine
at
barton
park
every
day
till
they
were
better
settled
at
home
that
though
his
entreaties
were
carried
to
a
point
of
perseverance
beyond
civility
they
could
not
give
offence
his
kindness
was
not
confined
to
words
for
within
an
hour
after
he
left
them
a
large
basket
full
of
garden
stuff
and
fruit
arrived
from
the
park
which
was
followed
before
the
end
of
the
day
by
a
present
of
game
he
insisted
moreover
on
conveying
all
their
letters
to
and
from
the
post
for
them
and
would
not
be
denied
the
satisfaction
of
sending
them
his
newspaper
every
day
lady
middleton
had
sent
a
very
civil
message
by
him
denoting
her
intention
of
waiting
on
mrs
dashwood
as
soon
as
she
could
be
assured
that
her
visit
would
be
no
inconvenience
and
as
this
message
was
answered
by
an
invitation
equally
polite
her
ladyship
was
introduced
to
them
the
next
day
they
were
of
course
very
anxious
to
see
a
person
on
whom
so
much
of
their
comfort
at
barton
must
depend
and
the
elegance
of
her
appearance
was
favourable
to
their
wishes
lady
middleton
was
not
more
than
six
or
seven
and
twenty
her
face
was
handsome
her
figure
tall
and
striking
and
her
address
graceful
her
manners
had
all
the
elegance
which
her
husband
s
wanted
but
they
would
have
been
improved
by
some
share
of
his
frankness
and
warmth
and
her
visit
was
long
enough
to
detract
something
from
their
first
admiration
by
shewing
that
though
perfectly
well
bred
she
was
reserved
cold
and
had
nothing
to
say
for
herself
beyond
the
most
common
place
inquiry
or
remark
conversation
however
was
not
wanted
for
sir
john
was
very
chatty
and
lady
middleton
had
taken
the
wise
precaution
of
bringing
with
her
their
eldest
child
a
fine
little
boy
about
six
years
old
by
which
means
there
was
one
subject
always
to
be
recurred
to
by
the
ladies
in
case
of
extremity
for
they
had
to
enquire
his
name
and
age
admire
his
beauty
and
ask
him
questions
which
his
mother
answered
for
him
while
he
hung
about
her
and
held
down
his
head
to
the
great
surprise
of
her
ladyship
who
wondered
at
his
being
so
shy
before
company
as
he
could
make
noise
enough
at
home
on
every
formal
visit
a
child
ought
to
be
of
the
party
by
way
of
provision
for
discourse
in
the
present
case
it
took
up
ten
minutes
to
determine
whether
the
boy
were
most
like
his
father
or
mother
and
in
what
particular
he
resembled
either
for
of
course
every
body
differed
and
every
body
was
astonished
at
the
opinion
of
the
others
an
opportunity
was
soon
to
be
given
to
the
dashwoods
of
debating
on
the
rest
of
the
children
as
sir
john
would
not
leave
the
house
without
securing
their
promise
of
dining
at
the
park
the
next
day
barton
park
was
about
half
a
mile
from
the
cottage
the
ladies
had
passed
near
it
in
their
way
along
the
valley
but
it
was
screened
from
their
view
at
home
by
the
projection
of
a
hill
the
house
was
large
and
handsome
and
the
middletons
lived
in
a
style
of
equal
hospitality
and
elegance
the
former
was
for
sir
john
s
gratification
the
latter
for
that
of
his
lady
they
were
scarcely
ever
without
some
friends
staying
with
them
in
the
house
and
they
kept
more
company
of
every
kind
than
any
other
family
in
the
neighbourhood
it
was
necessary
to
the
happiness
of
both
for
however
dissimilar
in
temper
and
outward
behaviour
they
strongly
resembled
each
other
in
that
total
want
of
talent
and
taste
which
confined
their
employments
unconnected
with
such
as
society
produced
within
a
very
narrow
compass
sir
john
was
a
sportsman
lady
middleton
a
mother
he
hunted
and
shot
and
she
humoured
her
children
and
these
were
their
only
resources
lady
middleton
had
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
spoil
her
children
all
the
year
round
while
sir
john
s
independent
employments
were
in
existence
only
half
the
time
continual
engagements
at
home
and
abroad
however
supplied
all
the
deficiencies
of
nature
and
education
supported
the
good
spirits
of
sir
john
and
gave
exercise
to
the
good
breeding
of
his
wife
lady
middleton
piqued
herself
upon
the
elegance
of
her
table
and
of
all
her
domestic
arrangements
and
from
this
kind
of
vanity
was
her
greatest
enjoyment
in
any
of
their
parties
but
sir
john
s
satisfaction
in
society
was
much
more
real
he
delighted
in
collecting
about
him
more
young
people
than
his
house
would
hold
and
the
noisier
they
were
the
better
was
he
pleased
he
was
a
blessing
to
all
the
juvenile
part
of
the
neighbourhood
for
in
summer
he
was
for
ever
forming
parties
to
eat
cold
ham
and
chicken
out
of
doors
and
in
winter
his
private
balls
were
numerous
enough
for
any
young
lady
who
was
not
suffering
under
the
unsatiable
appetite
of
fifteen
the
arrival
of
a
new
family
in
the
country
was
always
a
matter
of
joy
to
him
and
in
every
point
of
view
he
was
charmed
with
the
inhabitants
he
had
now
procured
for
his
cottage
at
barton
the
miss
dashwoods
were
young
pretty
and
unaffected
it
was
enough
to
secure
his
good
opinion
for
to
be
unaffected
was
all
that
a
pretty
girl
could
want
to
make
her
mind
as
captivating
as
her
person
the
friendliness
of
his
disposition
made
him
happy
in
accommodating
those
whose
situation
might
be
considered
in
comparison
with
the
past
as
unfortunate
in
showing
kindness
to
his
cousins
therefore
he
had
the
real
satisfaction
of
a
good
heart
and
in
settling
a
family
of
females
only
in
his
cottage
he
had
all
the
satisfaction
of
a
sportsman
for
a
sportsman
though
he
esteems
only
those
of
his
sex
who
are
sportsmen
likewise
is
not
often
desirous
of
encouraging
their
taste
by
admitting
them
to
a
residence
within
his
own
manor
mrs
dashwood
and
her
daughters
were
met
at
the
door
of
the
house
by
sir
john
who
welcomed
them
to
barton
park
with
unaffected
sincerity
and
as
he
attended
them
to
the
drawing
room
repeated
to
the
young
ladies
the
concern
which
the
same
subject
had
drawn
from
him
the
day
before
at
being
unable
to
get
any
smart
young
men
to
meet
them
they
would
see
he
said
only
one
gentleman
there
besides
himself
a
particular
friend
who
was
staying
at
the
park
but
who
was
neither
very
young
nor
very
gay
he
hoped
they
would
all
excuse
the
smallness
of
the
party
and
could
assure
them
it
should
never
happen
so
again
he
had
been
to
several
families
that
morning
in
hopes
of
procuring
some
addition
to
their
number
but
it
was
moonlight
and
every
body
was
full
of
engagements
luckily
lady
middleton
s
mother
had
arrived
at
barton
within
the
last
hour
and
as
she
was
a
very
cheerful
agreeable
woman
he
hoped
the
young
ladies
would
not
find
it
so
very
dull
as
they
might
imagine
the
young
ladies
as
well
as
their
mother
were
perfectly
satisfied
with
having
two
entire
strangers
of
the
party
and
wished
for
no
more
mrs
jennings
lady
middleton
s
mother
was
a
good
humoured
merry
fat
elderly
woman
who
talked
a
great
deal
seemed
very
happy
and
rather
vulgar
she
was
full
of
jokes
and
laughter
and
before
dinner
was
over
had
said
many
witty
things
on
the
subject
of
lovers
and
husbands
hoped
they
had
not
left
their
hearts
behind
them
in
sussex
and
pretended
to
see
them
blush
whether
they
did
or
not
marianne
was
vexed
at
it
for
her
sister
s
sake
and
turned
her
eyes
towards
elinor
to
see
how
she
bore
these
attacks
with
an
earnestness
which
gave
elinor
far
more
pain
than
could
arise
from
such
common
place
raillery
as
mrs
jennings
s
colonel
brandon
the
friend
of
sir
john
seemed
no
more
adapted
by
resemblance
of
manner
to
be
his
friend
than
lady
middleton
was
to
be
his
wife
or
mrs
jennings
to
be
lady
middleton
s
mother
he
was
silent
and
grave
his
appearance
however
was
not
unpleasing
in
spite
of
his
being
in
the
opinion
of
marianne
and
margaret
an
absolute
old
bachelor
for
he
was
on
the
wrong
side
of
five
and
thirty
but
though
his
face
was
not
handsome
his
countenance
was
sensible
and
his
address
was
particularly
gentlemanlike
there
was
nothing
in
any
of
the
party
which
could
recommend
them
as
companions
to
the
dashwoods
but
the
cold
insipidity
of
lady
middleton
was
so
particularly
repulsive
that
in
comparison
of
it
the
gravity
of
colonel
brandon
and
even
the
boisterous
mirth
of
sir
john
and
his
mother
in
law
was
interesting
lady
middleton
seemed
to
be
roused
to
enjoyment
only
by
the
entrance
of
her
four
noisy
children
after
dinner
who
pulled
her
about
tore
her
clothes
and
put
an
end
to
every
kind
of
discourse
except
what
related
to
themselves
in
the
evening
as
marianne
was
discovered
to
be
musical
she
was
invited
to
play
the
instrument
was
unlocked
every
body
prepared
to
be
charmed
and
marianne
who
sang
very
well
at
their
request
went
through
the
chief
of
the
songs
which
lady
middleton
had
brought
into
the
family
on
her
marriage
and
which
perhaps
had
lain
ever
since
in
the
same
position
on
the
pianoforte
for
her
ladyship
had
celebrated
that
event
by
giving
up
music
although
by
her
mother
s
account
she
had
played
extremely
well
and
by
her
own
was
very
fond
of
it
marianne
s
performance
was
highly
applauded
sir
john
was
loud
in
his
admiration
at
the
end
of
every
song
and
as
loud
in
his
conversation
with
the
others
while
every
song
lasted
lady
middleton
frequently
called
him
to
order
wondered
how
any
one
s
attention
could
be
diverted
from
music
for
a
moment
and
asked
marianne
to
sing
a
particular
song
which
marianne
had
just
finished
colonel
brandon
alone
of
all
the
party
heard
her
without
being
in
raptures
he
paid
her
only
the
compliment
of
attention
and
she
felt
a
respect
for
him
on
the
occasion
which
the
others
had
reasonably
forfeited
by
their
shameless
want
of
taste
his
pleasure
in
music
though
it
amounted
not
to
that
ecstatic
delight
which
alone
could
sympathize
with
her
own
was
estimable
when
contrasted
against
the
horrible
insensibility
of
the
others
and
she
was
reasonable
enough
to
allow
that
a
man
of
five
and
thirty
might
well
have
outlived
all
acuteness
of
feeling
and
every
exquisite
power
of
enjoyment
she
was
perfectly
disposed
to
make
every
allowance
for
the
colonel
s
advanced
state
of
life
which
humanity
required
mrs
jennings
was
a
widow
with
an
ample
jointure
she
had
only
two
daughters
both
of
whom
she
had
lived
to
see
respectably
married
and
she
had
now
therefore
nothing
to
do
but
to
marry
all
the
rest
of
the
world
in
the
promotion
of
this
object
she
was
zealously
active
as
far
as
her
ability
reached
and
missed
no
opportunity
of
projecting
weddings
among
all
the
young
people
of
her
acquaintance
she
was
remarkably
quick
in
the
discovery
of
attachments
and
had
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
raising
the
blushes
and
the
vanity
of
many
a
young
lady
by
insinuations
of
her
power
over
such
a
young
man
and
this
kind
of
discernment
enabled
her
soon
after
her
arrival
at
barton
decisively
to
pronounce
that
colonel
brandon
was
very
much
in
love
with
marianne
dashwood
she
rather
suspected
it
to
be
so
on
the
very
first
evening
of
their
being
together
from
his
listening
so
attentively
while
she
sang
to
them
and
when
the
visit
was
returned
by
the
middletons
dining
at
the
cottage
the
fact
was
ascertained
by
his
listening
to
her
again
it
must
be
so
she
was
perfectly
convinced
of
it
it
would
be
an
excellent
match
for
he
was
rich
and
she
was
handsome
mrs
jennings
had
been
anxious
to
see
colonel
brandon
well
married
ever
since
her
connection
with
sir
john
first
brought
him
to
her
knowledge
and
she
was
always
anxious
to
get
a
good
husband
for
every
pretty
girl
the
immediate
advantage
to
herself
was
by
no
means
inconsiderable
for
it
supplied
her
with
endless
jokes
against
them
both
at
the
park
she
laughed
at
the
colonel
and
in
the
cottage
at
marianne
to
the
former
her
raillery
was
probably
as
far
as
it
regarded
only
himself
perfectly
indifferent
but
to
the
latter
it
was
at
first
incomprehensible
and
when
its
object
was
understood
she
hardly
knew
whether
most
to
laugh
at
its
absurdity
or
censure
its
impertinence
for
she
considered
it
as
an
unfeeling
reflection
on
the
colonel
s
advanced
years
and
on
his
forlorn
condition
as
an
old
bachelor
mrs
dashwood
who
could
not
think
a
man
five
years
younger
than
herself
so
exceedingly
ancient
as
he
appeared
to
the
youthful
fancy
of
her
daughter
ventured
to
clear
mrs
jennings
from
the
probability
of
wishing
to
throw
ridicule
on
his
age
but
at
least
mama
you
cannot
deny
the
absurdity
of
the
accusation
though
you
may
not
think
it
intentionally
ill
natured
colonel
brandon
is
certainly
younger
than
mrs
jennings
but
he
is
old
enough
to
be
my
father
and
if
he
were
ever
animated
enough
to
be
in
love
must
have
long
outlived
every
sensation
of
the
kind
it
is
too
ridiculous
when
is
a
man
to
be
safe
from
such
wit
if
age
and
infirmity
will
not
protect
him
infirmity
said
elinor
do
you
call
colonel
brandon
infirm
i
can
easily
suppose
that
his
age
may
appear
much
greater
to
you
than
to
my
mother
but
you
can
hardly
deceive
yourself
as
to
his
having
the
use
of
his
limbs
did
not
you
hear
him
complain
of
the
rheumatism
and
is
not
that
the
commonest
infirmity
of
declining
life
my
dearest
child
said
her
mother
laughing
at
this
rate
you
must
be
in
continual
terror
of
my
decay
and
it
must
seem
to
you
a
miracle
that
my
life
has
been
extended
to
the
advanced
age
of
forty
mama
you
are
not
doing
me
justice
i
know
very
well
that
colonel
brandon
is
not
old
enough
to
make
his
friends
yet
apprehensive
of
losing
him
in
the
course
of
nature
he
may
live
twenty
years
longer
but
thirty
five
has
nothing
to
do
with
matrimony
perhaps
said
elinor
thirty
five
and
seventeen
had
better
not
have
any
thing
to
do
with
matrimony
together
but
if
there
should
by
any
chance
happen
to
be
a
woman
who
is
single
at
seven
and
twenty
i
should
not
think
colonel
brandon
s
being
thirty
five
any
objection
to
his
marrying
her
a
woman
of
seven
and
twenty
said
marianne
after
pausing
a
moment
can
never
hope
to
feel
or
inspire
affection
again
and
if
her
home
be
uncomfortable
or
her
fortune
small
i
can
suppose
that
she
might
bring
herself
to
submit
to
the
offices
of
a
nurse
for
the
sake
of
the
provision
and
security
of
a
wife
in
his
marrying
such
a
woman
therefore
there
would
be
nothing
unsuitable
it
would
be
a
compact
of
convenience
and
the
world
would
be
satisfied
in
my
eyes
it
would
be
no
marriage
at
all
but
that
would
be
nothing
to
me
it
would
seem
only
a
commercial
exchange
in
which
each
wished
to
be
benefited
at
the
expense
of
the
other
it
would
be
impossible
i
know
replied
elinor
to
convince
you
that
a
woman
of
seven
and
twenty
could
feel
for
a
man
of
thirty
five
anything
near
enough
to
love
to
make
him
a
desirable
companion
to
her
but
i
must
object
to
your
dooming
colonel
brandon
and
his
wife
to
the
constant
confinement
of
a
sick
chamber
merely
because
he
chanced
to
complain
yesterday
a
very
cold
damp
day
of
a
slight
rheumatic
feel
in
one
of
his
shoulders
but
he
talked
of
flannel
waistcoats
said
marianne
and
with
me
a
flannel
waistcoat
is
invariably
connected
with
aches
cramps
rheumatisms
and
every
species
of
ailment
that
can
afflict
the
old
and
the
feeble
had
he
been
only
in
a
violent
fever
you
would
not
have
despised
him
half
so
much
confess
marianne
is
not
there
something
interesting
to
you
in
the
flushed
cheek
hollow
eye
and
quick
pulse
of
a
fever
soon
after
this
upon
elinor
s
leaving
the
room
mama
said
marianne
i
have
an
alarm
on
the
subject
of
illness
which
i
cannot
conceal
from
you
i
am
sure
edward
ferrars
is
not
well
we
have
now
been
here
almost
a
fortnight
and
yet
he
does
not
come
nothing
but
real
indisposition
could
occasion
this
extraordinary
delay
what
else
can
detain
him
at
norland
had
you
any
idea
of
his
coming
so
soon
said
mrs
dashwood
i
had
none
on
the
contrary
if
i
have
felt
any
anxiety
at
all
on
the
subject
it
has
been
in
recollecting
that
he
sometimes
showed
a
want
of
pleasure
and
readiness
in
accepting
my
invitation
when
i
talked
of
his
coming
to
barton
does
elinor
expect
him
already
i
have
never
mentioned
it
to
her
but
of
course
she
must
i
rather
think
you
are
mistaken
for
when
i
was
talking
to
her
yesterday
of
getting
a
new
grate
for
the
spare
bedchamber
she
observed
that
there
was
no
immediate
hurry
for
it
as
it
was
not
likely
that
the
room
would
be
wanted
for
some
time
how
strange
this
is
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
it
but
the
whole
of
their
behaviour
to
each
other
has
been
unaccountable
how
cold
how
composed
were
their
last
adieus
how
languid
their
conversation
the
last
evening
of
their
being
together
in
edward
s
farewell
there
was
no
distinction
between
elinor
and
me
it
was
the
good
wishes
of
an
affectionate
brother
to
both
twice
did
i
leave
them
purposely
together
in
the
course
of
the
last
morning
and
each
time
did
he
most
unaccountably
follow
me
out
of
the
room
and
elinor
in
quitting
norland
and
edward
cried
not
as
i
did
even
now
her
self
command
is
invariable
when
is
she
dejected
or
melancholy
when
does
she
try
to
avoid
society
or
appear
restless
and
dissatisfied
in
it
the
dashwoods
were
now
settled
at
barton
with
tolerable
comfort
to
themselves
the
house
and
the
garden
with
all
the
objects
surrounding
them
were
now
become
familiar
and
the
ordinary
pursuits
which
had
given
to
norland
half
its
charms
were
engaged
in
again
with
far
greater
enjoyment
than
norland
had
been
able
to
afford
since
the
loss
of
their
father
sir
john
middleton
who
called
on
them
every
day
for
the
first
fortnight
and
who
was
not
in
the
habit
of
seeing
much
occupation
at
home
could
not
conceal
his
amazement
on
finding
them
always
employed
their
visitors
except
those
from
barton
park
were
not
many
for
in
spite
of
sir
john
s
urgent
entreaties
that
they
would
mix
more
in
the
neighbourhood
and
repeated
assurances
of
his
carriage
being
always
at
their
service
the
independence
of
mrs
dashwood
s
spirit
overcame
the
wish
of
society
for
her
children
and
she
was
resolute
in
declining
to
visit
any
family
beyond
the
distance
of
a
walk
there
were
but
few
who
could
be
so
classed
and
it
was
not
all
of
them
that
were
attainable
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
cottage
along
the
narrow
winding
valley
of
allenham
which
issued
from
that
of
barton
as
formerly
described
the
girls
had
in
one
of
their
earliest
walks
discovered
an
ancient
respectable
looking
mansion
which
by
reminding
them
a
little
of
norland
interested
their
imagination
and
made
them
wish
to
be
better
acquainted
with
it
but
they
learnt
on
enquiry
that
its
possessor
an
elderly
lady
of
very
good
character
was
unfortunately
too
infirm
to
mix
with
the
world
and
never
stirred
from
home
the
whole
country
about
them
abounded
in
beautiful
walks
the
high
downs
which
invited
them
from
almost
every
window
of
the
cottage
to
seek
the
exquisite
enjoyment
of
air
on
their
summits
were
a
happy
alternative
when
the
dirt
of
the
valleys
beneath
shut
up
their
superior
beauties
and
towards
one
of
these
hills
did
marianne
and
margaret
one
memorable
morning
direct
their
steps
attracted
by
the
partial
sunshine
of
a
showery
sky
and
unable
longer
to
bear
the
confinement
which
the
settled
rain
of
the
two
preceding
days
had
occasioned
the
weather
was
not
tempting
enough
to
draw
the
two
others
from
their
pencil
and
their
book
in
spite
of
marianne
s
declaration
that
the
day
would
be
lastingly
fair
and
that
every
threatening
cloud
would
be
drawn
off
from
their
hills
and
the
two
girls
set
off
together
they
gaily
ascended
the
downs
rejoicing
in
their
own
penetration
at
every
glimpse
of
blue
sky
and
when
they
caught
in
their
faces
the
animating
gales
of
a
high
south
westerly
wind
they
pitied
the
fears
which
had
prevented
their
mother
and
elinor
from
sharing
such
delightful
sensations
is
there
a
felicity
in
the
world
said
marianne
superior
to
this
margaret
we
will
walk
here
at
least
two
hours
margaret
agreed
and
they
pursued
their
way
against
the
wind
resisting
it
with
laughing
delight
for
about
twenty
minutes
longer
when
suddenly
the
clouds
united
over
their
heads
and
a
driving
rain
set
full
in
their
face
chagrined
and
surprised
they
were
obliged
though
unwillingly
to
turn
back
for
no
shelter
was
nearer
than
their
own
house
one
consolation
however
remained
for
them
to
which
the
exigence
of
the
moment
gave
more
than
usual
propriety
it
was
that
of
running
with
all
possible
speed
down
the
steep
side
of
the
hill
which
led
immediately
to
their
garden
gate
they
set
off
marianne
had
at
first
the
advantage
but
a
false
step
brought
her
suddenly
to
the
ground
and
margaret
unable
to
stop
herself
to
assist
her
was
involuntarily
hurried
along
and
reached
the
bottom
in
safety
a
gentleman
carrying
a
gun
with
two
pointers
playing
round
him
was
passing
up
the
hill
and
within
a
few
yards
of
marianne
when
her
accident
happened
he
put
down
his
gun
and
ran
to
her
assistance
she
had
raised
herself
from
the
ground
but
her
foot
had
been
twisted
in
her
fall
and
she
was
scarcely
able
to
stand
the
gentleman
offered
his
services
and
perceiving
that
her
modesty
declined
what
her
situation
rendered
necessary
took
her
up
in
his
arms
without
farther
delay
and
carried
her
down
the
hill
then
passing
through
the
garden
the
gate
of
which
had
been
left
open
by
margaret
he
bore
her
directly
into
the
house
whither
margaret
was
just
arrived
and
quitted
not
his
hold
till
he
had
seated
her
in
a
chair
in
the
parlour
elinor
and
her
mother
rose
up
in
amazement
at
their
entrance
and
while
the
eyes
of
both
were
fixed
on
him
with
an
evident
wonder
and
a
secret
admiration
which
equally
sprung
from
his
appearance
he
apologized
for
his
intrusion
by
relating
its
cause
in
a
manner
so
frank
and
so
graceful
that
his
person
which
was
uncommonly
handsome
received
additional
charms
from
his
voice
and
expression
had
he
been
even
old
ugly
and
vulgar
the
gratitude
and
kindness
of
mrs
dashwood
would
have
been
secured
by
any
act
of
attention
to
her
child
but
the
influence
of
youth
beauty
and
elegance
gave
an
interest
to
the
action
which
came
home
to
her
feelings
she
thanked
him
again
and
again
and
with
a
sweetness
of
address
which
always
attended
her
invited
him
to
be
seated
but
this
he
declined
as
he
was
dirty
and
wet
mrs
dashwood
then
begged
to
know
to
whom
she
was
obliged
his
name
he
replied
was
willoughby
and
his
present
home
was
at
allenham
from
whence
he
hoped
she
would
allow
him
the
honour
of
calling
tomorrow
to
enquire
after
miss
dashwood
the
honour
was
readily
granted
and
he
then
departed
to
make
himself
still
more
interesting
in
the
midst
of
a
heavy
rain
his
manly
beauty
and
more
than
common
gracefulness
were
instantly
the
theme
of
general
admiration
and
the
laugh
which
his
gallantry
raised
against
marianne
received
particular
spirit
from
his
exterior
attractions
marianne
herself
had
seen
less
of
his
mama
the
rest
for
the
confusion
which
crimsoned
over
her
face
on
his
lifting
her
up
had
robbed
her
of
the
power
of
regarding
him
after
their
entering
the
house
but
she
had
seen
enough
of
him
to
join
in
all
the
admiration
of
the
others
and
with
an
energy
which
always
adorned
her
praise
his
person
and
air
were
equal
to
what
her
fancy
had
ever
drawn
for
the
hero
of
a
favourite
story
and
in
his
carrying
her
into
the
house
with
so
little
previous
formality
there
was
a
rapidity
of
thought
which
particularly
recommended
the
action
to
her
every
circumstance
belonging
to
him
was
interesting
his
name
was
good
his
residence
was
in
their
favourite
village
and
she
soon
found
out
that
of
all
manly
dresses
a
shooting
jacket
was
the
most
becoming
her
imagination
was
busy
her
reflections
were
pleasant
and
the
pain
of
a
sprained
ankle
was
disregarded
sir
john
called
on
them
as
soon
as
the
next
interval
of
fair
weather
that
morning
allowed
him
to
get
out
of
doors
and
marianne
s
accident
being
related
to
him
he
was
eagerly
asked
whether
he
knew
any
gentleman
of
the
name
of
willoughby
at
allenham
willoughby
cried
sir
john
what
is
he
in
the
country
that
is
good
news
however
i
will
ride
over
tomorrow
and
ask
him
to
dinner
on
thursday
you
know
him
then
said
mrs
dashwood
know
him
to
be
sure
i
do
why
he
is
down
here
every
year
and
what
sort
of
a
young
man
is
he
as
good
a
kind
of
fellow
as
ever
lived
i
assure
you
a
very
decent
shot
and
there
is
not
a
bolder
rider
in
england
and
is
that
all
you
can
say
for
him
cried
marianne
indignantly
but
what
are
his
manners
on
more
intimate
acquaintance
what
his
pursuits
his
talents
and
genius
sir
john
was
rather
puzzled
upon
my
soul
said
he
i
do
not
know
much
about
him
as
to
all
that
but
he
is
a
pleasant
good
humoured
fellow
and
has
got
the
nicest
little
black
bitch
of
a
pointer
i
ever
saw
was
she
out
with
him
today
but
marianne
could
no
more
satisfy
him
as
to
the
colour
of
mr
willoughby
s
pointer
than
he
could
describe
to
her
the
shades
of
his
mind
but
who
is
he
said
elinor
where
does
he
come
from
has
he
a
house
at
allenham
on
this
point
sir
john
could
give
more
certain
intelligence
and
he
told
them
that
mr
willoughby
had
no
property
of
his
own
in
the
country
that
he
resided
there
only
while
he
was
visiting
the
old
lady
at
allenham
court
to
whom
he
was
related
and
whose
possessions
he
was
to
inherit
adding
yes
yes
he
is
very
well
worth
catching
i
can
tell
you
miss
dashwood
he
has
a
pretty
little
estate
of
his
own
in
somersetshire
besides
and
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
give
him
up
to
my
younger
sister
in
spite
of
all
this
tumbling
down
hills
miss
marianne
must
not
expect
to
have
all
the
men
to
herself
brandon
will
be
jealous
if
she
does
not
take
care
i
do
not
believe
said
mrs
dashwood
with
a
good
humoured
smile
that
mr
willoughby
will
be
incommoded
by
the
attempts
of
either
of
my
daughters
towards
what
you
call
catching
him
it
is
not
an
employment
to
which
they
have
been
brought
up
men
are
very
safe
with
us
let
them
be
ever
so
rich
i
am
glad
to
find
however
from
what
you
say
that
he
is
a
respectable
young
man
and
one
whose
acquaintance
will
not
be
ineligible
he
is
as
good
a
sort
of
fellow
i
believe
as
ever
lived
repeated
sir
john
i
remember
last
christmas
at
a
little
hop
at
the
park
he
danced
from
eight
o
clock
till
four
without
once
sitting
down
did
he
indeed
cried
marianne
with
sparkling
eyes
and
with
elegance
with
spirit
yes
and
he
was
up
again
at
eight
to
ride
to
covert
that
is
what
i
like
that
is
what
a
young
man
ought
to
be
whatever
be
his
pursuits
his
eagerness
in
them
should
know
no
moderation
and
leave
him
no
sense
of
fatigue
aye
aye
i
see
how
it
will
be
said
sir
john
i
see
how
it
will
be
you
will
be
setting
your
cap
at
him
now
and
never
think
of
poor
brandon
that
is
an
expression
sir
john
said
marianne
warmly
which
i
particularly
dislike
i
abhor
every
common
place
phrase
by
which
wit
is
intended
and
setting
one
s
cap
at
a
man
or
making
a
conquest
are
the
most
odious
of
all
their
tendency
is
gross
and
illiberal
and
if
their
construction
could
ever
be
deemed
clever
time
has
long
ago
destroyed
all
its
ingenuity
sir
john
did
not
much
understand
this
reproof
but
he
laughed
as
heartily
as
if
he
did
and
then
replied
ay
you
will
make
conquests
enough
i
dare
say
one
way
or
other
poor
brandon
he
is
quite
smitten
already
and
he
is
very
well
worth
setting
your
cap
at
i
can
tell
you
in
spite
of
all
this
tumbling
about
and
spraining
of
ankles
marianne
s
preserver
as
margaret
with
more
elegance
than
precision
styled
willoughby
called
at
the
cottage
early
the
next
morning
to
make
his
personal
enquiries
he
was
received
by
mrs
dashwood
with
more
than
politeness
with
a
kindness
which
sir
john
s
account
of
him
and
her
own
gratitude
prompted
and
every
thing
that
passed
during
the
visit
tended
to
assure
him
of
the
sense
elegance
mutual
affection
and
domestic
comfort
of
the
family
to
whom
accident
had
now
introduced
him
of
their
personal
charms
he
had
not
required
a
second
interview
to
be
convinced
miss
dashwood
had
a
delicate
complexion
regular
features
and
a
remarkably
pretty
figure
marianne
was
still
handsomer
her
form
though
not
so
correct
as
her
sister
s
in
having
the
advantage
of
height
was
more
striking
and
her
face
was
so
lovely
that
when
in
the
common
cant
of
praise
she
was
called
a
beautiful
girl
truth
was
less
violently
outraged
than
usually
happens
her
skin
was
very
brown
but
from
its
transparency
her
complexion
was
uncommonly
brilliant
her
features
were
all
good
her
smile
was
sweet
and
attractive
and
in
her
eyes
which
were
very
dark
there
was
a
life
a
spirit
an
eagerness
which
could
hardily
be
seen
without
delight
from
willoughby
their
expression
was
at
first
held
back
by
the
embarrassment
which
the
remembrance
of
his
assistance
created
but
when
this
passed
away
when
her
spirits
became
collected
when
she
saw
that
to
the
perfect
good
breeding
of
the
gentleman
he
united
frankness
and
vivacity
and
above
all
when
she
heard
him
declare
that
of
music
and
dancing
he
was
passionately
fond
she
gave
him
such
a
look
of
approbation
as
secured
the
largest
share
of
his
discourse
to
herself
for
the
rest
of
his
stay
it
was
only
necessary
to
mention
any
favourite
amusement
to
engage
her
to
talk
she
could
not
be
silent
when
such
points
were
introduced
and
she
had
neither
shyness
nor
reserve
in
their
discussion
they
speedily
discovered
that
their
enjoyment
of
dancing
and
music
was
mutual
and
that
it
arose
from
a
general
conformity
of
judgment
in
all
that
related
to
either
encouraged
by
this
to
a
further
examination
of
his
opinions
she
proceeded
to
question
him
on
the
subject
of
books
her
favourite
authors
were
brought
forward
and
dwelt
upon
with
so
rapturous
a
delight
that
any
young
man
of
five
and
twenty
must
have
been
insensible
indeed
not
to
become
an
immediate
convert
to
the
excellence
of
such
works
however
disregarded
before
their
taste
was
strikingly
alike
the
same
books
the
same
passages
were
idolized
by
each
or
if
any
difference
appeared
any
objection
arose
it
lasted
no
longer
than
till
the
force
of
her
arguments
and
the
brightness
of
her
eyes
could
be
displayed
he
acquiesced
in
all
her
decisions
caught
all
her
enthusiasm
and
long
before
his
visit
concluded
they
conversed
with
the
familiarity
of
a
long
established
acquaintance
well
marianne
said
elinor
as
soon
as
he
had
left
them
for
one
morning
i
think
you
have
done
pretty
well
you
have
already
ascertained
mr
willoughby
s
opinion
in
almost
every
matter
of
importance
you
know
what
he
thinks
of
cowper
and
scott
you
are
certain
of
his
estimating
their
beauties
as
he
ought
and
you
have
received
every
assurance
of
his
admiring
pope
no
more
than
is
proper
but
how
is
your
acquaintance
to
be
long
supported
under
such
extraordinary
despatch
of
every
subject
for
discourse
you
will
soon
have
exhausted
each
favourite
topic
another
meeting
will
suffice
to
explain
his
sentiments
on
picturesque
beauty
and
second
marriages
and
then
you
can
have
nothing
farther
to
ask
elinor
cried
marianne
is
this
fair
is
this
just
are
my
ideas
so
scanty
but
i
see
what
you
mean
i
have
been
too
much
at
my
ease
too
happy
too
frank
i
have
erred
against
every
common
place
notion
of
decorum
i
have
been
open
and
sincere
where
i
ought
to
have
been
reserved
spiritless
dull
and
deceitful
had
i
talked
only
of
the
weather
and
the
roads
and
had
i
spoken
only
once
in
ten
minutes
this
reproach
would
have
been
spared
my
love
said
her
mother
you
must
not
be
offended
with
elinor
she
was
only
in
jest
i
should
scold
her
myself
if
she
were
capable
of
wishing
to
check
the
delight
of
your
conversation
with
our
new
friend
marianne
was
softened
in
a
moment
willoughby
on
his
side
gave
every
proof
of
his
pleasure
in
their
acquaintance
which
an
evident
wish
of
improving
it
could
offer
he
came
to
them
every
day
to
enquire
after
marianne
was
at
first
his
excuse
but
the
encouragement
of
his
reception
to
which
every
day
gave
greater
kindness
made
such
an
excuse
unnecessary
before
it
had
ceased
to
be
possible
by
marianne
s
perfect
recovery
she
was
confined
for
some
days
to
the
house
but
never
had
any
confinement
been
less
irksome
willoughby
was
a
young
man
of
good
abilities
quick
imagination
lively
spirits
and
open
affectionate
manners
he
was
exactly
formed
to
engage
marianne
s
heart
for
with
all
this
he
joined
not
only
a
captivating
person
but
a
natural
ardour
of
mind
which
was
now
roused
and
increased
by
the
example
of
her
own
and
which
recommended
him
to
her
affection
beyond
every
thing
else
his
society
became
gradually
her
most
exquisite
enjoyment
they
read
they
talked
they
sang
together
his
musical
talents
were
considerable
and
he
read
with
all
the
sensibility
and
spirit
which
edward
had
unfortunately
wanted
in
mrs
dashwood
s
estimation
he
was
as
faultless
as
in
marianne
s
and
elinor
saw
nothing
to
censure
in
him
but
a
propensity
in
which
he
strongly
resembled
and
peculiarly
delighted
her
sister
of
saying
too
much
what
he
thought
on
every
occasion
without
attention
to
persons
or
circumstances
in
hastily
forming
and
giving
his
opinion
of
other
people
in
sacrificing
general
politeness
to
the
enjoyment
of
undivided
attention
where
his
heart
was
engaged
and
in
slighting
too
easily
the
forms
of
worldly
propriety
he
displayed
a
want
of
caution
which
elinor
could
not
approve
in
spite
of
all
that
he
and
marianne
could
say
in
its
support
marianne
began
now
to
perceive
that
the
desperation
which
had
seized
her
at
sixteen
and
a
half
of
ever
seeing
a
man
who
could
satisfy
her
ideas
of
perfection
had
been
rash
and
unjustifiable
willoughby
was
all
that
her
fancy
had
delineated
in
that
unhappy
hour
and
in
every
brighter
period
as
capable
of
attaching
her
and
his
behaviour
declared
his
wishes
to
be
in
that
respect
as
earnest
as
his
abilities
were
strong
her
mother
too
in
whose
mind
not
one
speculative
thought
of
their
marriage
had
been
raised
by
his
prospect
of
riches
was
led
before
the
end
of
a
week
to
hope
and
expect
it
and
secretly
to
congratulate
herself
on
having
gained
two
such
sons
in
law
as
edward
and
willoughby
colonel
brandon
s
partiality
for
marianne
which
had
so
early
been
discovered
by
his
friends
now
first
became
perceptible
to
elinor
when
it
ceased
to
be
noticed
by
them
their
attention
and
wit
were
drawn
off
to
his
more
fortunate
rival
and
the
raillery
which
the
other
had
incurred
before
any
partiality
arose
was
removed
when
his
feelings
began
really
to
call
for
the
ridicule
so
justly
annexed
to
sensibility
elinor
was
obliged
though
unwillingly
to
believe
that
the
sentiments
which
mrs
jennings
had
assigned
him
for
her
own
satisfaction
were
now
actually
excited
by
her
sister
and
that
however
a
general
resemblance
of
disposition
between
the
parties
might
forward
the
affection
of
mr
willoughby
an
equally
striking
opposition
of
character
was
no
hindrance
to
the
regard
of
colonel
brandon
she
saw
it
with
concern
for
what
could
a
silent
man
of
five
and
thirty
hope
when
opposed
to
a
very
lively
one
of
five
and
twenty
and
as
she
could
not
even
wish
him
successful
she
heartily
wished
him
indifferent
she
liked
him
in
spite
of
his
gravity
and
reserve
she
beheld
in
him
an
object
of
interest
his
manners
though
serious
were
mild
and
his
reserve
appeared
rather
the
result
of
some
oppression
of
spirits
than
of
any
natural
gloominess
of
temper
sir
john
had
dropped
hints
of
past
injuries
and
disappointments
which
justified
her
belief
of
his
being
an
unfortunate
man
and
she
regarded
him
with
respect
and
compassion
perhaps
she
pitied
and
esteemed
him
the
more
because
he
was
slighted
by
willoughby
and
marianne
who
prejudiced
against
him
for
being
neither
lively
nor
young
seemed
resolved
to
undervalue
his
merits
brandon
is
just
the
kind
of
man
said
willoughby
one
day
when
they
were
talking
of
him
together
whom
every
body
speaks
well
of
and
nobody
cares
about
whom
all
are
delighted
to
see
and
nobody
remembers
to
talk
to
that
is
exactly
what
i
think
of
him
cried
marianne
do
not
boast
of
it
however
said
elinor
for
it
is
injustice
in
both
of
you
he
is
highly
esteemed
by
all
the
family
at
the
park
and
i
never
see
him
myself
without
taking
pains
to
converse
with
him
that
he
is
patronised
by
you
replied
willoughby
is
certainly
in
his
favour
but
as
for
the
esteem
of
the
others
it
is
a
reproach
in
itself
who
would
submit
to
the
indignity
of
being
approved
by
such
a
woman
as
lady
middleton
and
mrs
jennings
that
could
command
the
indifference
of
any
body
else
but
perhaps
the
abuse
of
such
people
as
yourself
and
marianne
will
make
amends
for
the
regard
of
lady
middleton
and
her
mother
if
their
praise
is
censure
your
censure
may
be
praise
for
they
are
not
more
undiscerning
than
you
are
prejudiced
and
unjust
in
defence
of
your
protege
you
can
even
be
saucy
my
protege
as
you
call
him
is
a
sensible
man
and
sense
will
always
have
attractions
for
me
yes
marianne
even
in
a
man
between
thirty
and
forty
he
has
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
has
been
abroad
has
read
and
has
a
thinking
mind
i
have
found
him
capable
of
giving
me
much
information
on
various
subjects
and
he
has
always
answered
my
inquiries
with
readiness
of
good
breeding
and
good
nature
that
is
to
say
cried
marianne
contemptuously
he
has
told
you
that
in
the
east
indies
the
climate
is
hot
and
the
mosquitoes
are
troublesome
he
would
have
told
me
so
i
doubt
not
had
i
made
any
such
inquiries
but
they
happened
to
be
points
on
which
i
had
been
previously
informed
perhaps
said
willoughby
his
observations
may
have
extended
to
the
existence
of
nabobs
gold
mohrs
and
palanquins
i
may
venture
to
say
that
his
observations
have
stretched
much
further
than
your
candour
but
why
should
you
dislike
him
i
do
not
dislike
him
i
consider
him
on
the
contrary
as
a
very
respectable
man
who
has
every
body
s
good
word
and
nobody
s
notice
who
has
more
money
than
he
can
spend
more
time
than
he
knows
how
to
employ
and
two
new
coats
every
year
add
to
which
cried
marianne
that
he
has
neither
genius
taste
nor
spirit
that
his
understanding
has
no
brilliancy
his
feelings
no
ardour
and
his
voice
no
expression
you
decide
on
his
imperfections
so
much
in
the
mass
replied
elinor
and
so
much
on
the
strength
of
your
own
imagination
that
the
commendation
i
am
able
to
give
of
him
is
comparatively
cold
and
insipid
i
can
only
pronounce
him
to
be
a
sensible
man
well
bred
well
informed
of
gentle
address
and
i
believe
possessing
an
amiable
heart
miss
dashwood
cried
willoughby
you
are
now
using
me
unkindly
you
are
endeavouring
to
disarm
me
by
reason
and
to
convince
me
against
my
will
but
it
will
not
do
you
shall
find
me
as
stubborn
as
you
can
be
artful
i
have
three
unanswerable
reasons
for
disliking
colonel
brandon
he
threatened
me
with
rain
when
i
wanted
it
to
be
fine
he
has
found
fault
with
the
hanging
of
my
curricle
and
i
cannot
persuade
him
to
buy
my
brown
mare
if
it
will
be
any
satisfaction
to
you
however
to
be
told
that
i
believe
his
character
to
be
in
other
respects
irreproachable
i
am
ready
to
confess
it
and
in
return
for
an
acknowledgment
which
must
give
me
some
pain
you
cannot
deny
me
the
privilege
of
disliking
him
as
much
as
ever
little
had
mrs
dashwood
or
her
daughters
imagined
when
they
first
came
into
devonshire
that
so
many
engagements
would
arise
to
occupy
their
time
as
shortly
presented
themselves
or
that
they
should
have
such
frequent
invitations
and
such
constant
visitors
as
to
leave
them
little
leisure
for
serious
employment
yet
such
was
the
case
when
marianne
was
recovered
the
schemes
of
amusement
at
home
and
abroad
which
sir
john
had
been
previously
forming
were
put
into
execution
the
private
balls
at
the
park
then
began
and
parties
on
the
water
were
made
and
accomplished
as
often
as
a
showery
october
would
allow
in
every
meeting
of
the
kind
willoughby
was
included
and
the
ease
and
familiarity
which
naturally
attended
these
parties
were
exactly
calculated
to
give
increasing
intimacy
to
his
acquaintance
with
the
dashwoods
to
afford
him
opportunity
of
witnessing
the
excellencies
of
marianne
of
marking
his
animated
admiration
of
her
and
of
receiving
in
her
behaviour
to
himself
the
most
pointed
assurance
of
her
affection
elinor
could
not
be
surprised
at
their
attachment
she
only
wished
that
it
were
less
openly
shewn
and
once
or
twice
did
venture
to
suggest
the
propriety
of
some
self
command
to
marianne
but
marianne
abhorred
all
concealment
where
no
real
disgrace
could
attend
unreserve
and
to
aim
at
the
restraint
of
sentiments
which
were
not
in
themselves
illaudable
appeared
to
her
not
merely
an
unnecessary
effort
but
a
disgraceful
subjection
of
reason
to
common
place
and
mistaken
notions
willoughby
thought
the
same
and
their
behaviour
at
all
times
was
an
illustration
of
their
opinions
when
he
was
present
she
had
no
eyes
for
any
one
else
every
thing
he
did
was
right
every
thing
he
said
was
clever
if
their
evenings
at
the
park
were
concluded
with
cards
he
cheated
himself
and
all
the
rest
of
the
party
to
get
her
a
good
hand
if
dancing
formed
the
amusement
of
the
night
they
were
partners
for
half
the
time
and
when
obliged
to
separate
for
a
couple
of
dances
were
careful
to
stand
together
and
scarcely
spoke
a
word
to
any
body
else
such
conduct
made
them
of
course
most
exceedingly
laughed
at
but
ridicule
could
not
shame
and
seemed
hardly
to
provoke
them
mrs
dashwood
entered
into
all
their
feelings
with
a
warmth
which
left
her
no
inclination
for
checking
this
excessive
display
of
them
to
her
it
was
but
the
natural
consequence
of
a
strong
affection
in
a
young
and
ardent
mind
this
was
the
season
of
happiness
to
marianne
her
heart
was
devoted
to
willoughby
and
the
fond
attachment
to
norland
which
she
brought
with
her
from
sussex
was
more
likely
to
be
softened
than
she
had
thought
it
possible
before
by
the
charms
which
his
society
bestowed
on
her
present
home
elinor
s
happiness
was
not
so
great
her
heart
was
not
so
much
at
ease
nor
her
satisfaction
in
their
amusements
so
pure
they
afforded
her
no
companion
that
could
make
amends
for
what
she
had
left
behind
nor
that
could
teach
her
to
think
of
norland
with
less
regret
than
ever
neither
lady
middleton
nor
mrs
jennings
could
supply
to
her
the
conversation
she
missed
although
the
latter
was
an
everlasting
talker
and
from
the
first
had
regarded
her
with
a
kindness
which
ensured
her
a
large
share
of
her
discourse
she
had
already
repeated
her
own
history
to
elinor
three
or
four
times
and
had
elinor
s
memory
been
equal
to
her
means
of
improvement
she
might
have
known
very
early
in
their
acquaintance
all
the
particulars
of
mr
jennings
s
last
illness
and
what
he
said
to
his
wife
a
few
minutes
before
he
died
lady
middleton
was
more
agreeable
than
her
mother
only
in
being
more
silent
elinor
needed
little
observation
to
perceive
that
her
reserve
was
a
mere
calmness
of
manner
with
which
sense
had
nothing
to
do
towards
her
husband
and
mother
she
was
the
same
as
to
them
and
intimacy
was
therefore
neither
to
be
looked
for
nor
desired
she
had
nothing
to
say
one
day
that
she
had
not
said
the
day
before
her
insipidity
was
invariable
for
even
her
spirits
were
always
the
same
and
though
she
did
not
oppose
the
parties
arranged
by
her
husband
provided
every
thing
were
conducted
in
style
and
her
two
eldest
children
attended
her
she
never
appeared
to
receive
more
enjoyment
from
them
than
she
might
have
experienced
in
sitting
at
home
and
so
little
did
her
presence
add
to
the
pleasure
of
the
others
by
any
share
in
their
conversation
that
they
were
sometimes
only
reminded
of
her
being
amongst
them
by
her
solicitude
about
her
troublesome
boys
in
colonel
brandon
alone
of
all
her
new
acquaintance
did
elinor
find
a
person
who
could
in
any
degree
claim
the
respect
of
abilities
excite
the
interest
of
friendship
or
give
pleasure
as
a
companion
willoughby
was
out
of
the
question
her
admiration
and
regard
even
her
sisterly
regard
was
all
his
own
but
he
was
a
lover
his
attentions
were
wholly
marianne
s
and
a
far
less
agreeable
man
might
have
been
more
generally
pleasing
colonel
brandon
unfortunately
for
himself
had
no
such
encouragement
to
think
only
of
marianne
and
in
conversing
with
elinor
he
found
the
greatest
consolation
for
the
indifference
of
her
sister
elinor
s
compassion
for
him
increased
as
she
had
reason
to
suspect
that
the
misery
of
disappointed
love
had
already
been
known
to
him
this
suspicion
was
given
by
some
words
which
accidentally
dropped
from
him
one
evening
at
the
park
when
they
were
sitting
down
together
by
mutual
consent
while
the
others
were
dancing
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
marianne
and
after
a
silence
of
some
minutes
he
said
with
a
faint
smile
your
sister
i
understand
does
not
approve
of
second
attachments
no
replied
elinor
her
opinions
are
all
romantic
or
rather
as
i
believe
she
considers
them
impossible
to
exist
i
believe
she
does
but
how
she
contrives
it
without
reflecting
on
the
character
of
her
own
father
who
had
himself
two
wives
i
know
not
a
few
years
however
will
settle
her
opinions
on
the
reasonable
basis
of
common
sense
and
observation
and
then
they
may
be
more
easy
to
define
and
to
justify
than
they
now
are
by
any
body
but
herself
this
will
probably
be
the
case
he
replied
and
yet
there
is
something
so
amiable
in
the
prejudices
of
a
young
mind
that
one
is
sorry
to
see
them
give
way
to
the
reception
of
more
general
opinions
i
cannot
agree
with
you
there
said
elinor
there
are
inconveniences
attending
such
feelings
as
marianne
s
which
all
the
charms
of
enthusiasm
and
ignorance
of
the
world
cannot
atone
for
her
systems
have
all
the
unfortunate
tendency
of
setting
propriety
at
nought
and
a
better
acquaintance
with
the
world
is
what
i
look
forward
to
as
her
greatest
possible
advantage
after
a
short
pause
he
resumed
the
conversation
by
saying
does
your
sister
make
no
distinction
in
her
objections
against
a
second
attachment
or
is
it
equally
criminal
in
every
body
are
those
who
have
been
disappointed
in
their
first
choice
whether
from
the
inconstancy
of
its
object
or
the
perverseness
of
circumstances
to
be
equally
indifferent
during
the
rest
of
their
lives
upon
my
word
i
am
not
acquainted
with
the
minutiae
of
her
principles
i
only
know
that
i
never
yet
heard
her
admit
any
instance
of
a
second
attachment
s
being
pardonable
this
said
he
cannot
hold
but
a
change
a
total
change
of
sentiments
no
no
do
not
desire
it
for
when
the
romantic
refinements
of
a
young
mind
are
obliged
to
give
way
how
frequently
are
they
succeeded
by
such
opinions
as
are
but
too
common
and
too
dangerous
i
speak
from
experience
i
once
knew
a
lady
who
in
temper
and
mind
greatly
resembled
your
sister
who
thought
and
judged
like
her
but
who
from
an
inforced
change
from
a
series
of
unfortunate
circumstances
here
he
stopt
suddenly
appeared
to
think
that
he
had
said
too
much
and
by
his
countenance
gave
rise
to
conjectures
which
might
not
otherwise
have
entered
elinor
s
head
the
lady
would
probably
have
passed
without
suspicion
had
he
not
convinced
miss
dashwood
that
what
concerned
her
ought
not
to
escape
his
lips
as
it
was
it
required
but
a
slight
effort
of
fancy
to
connect
his
emotion
with
the
tender
recollection
of
past
regard
elinor
attempted
no
more
but
marianne
in
her
place
would
not
have
done
so
little
the
whole
story
would
have
been
speedily
formed
under
her
active
imagination
and
every
thing
established
in
the
most
melancholy
order
of
disastrous
love
as
elinor
and
marianne
were
walking
together
the
next
morning
the
latter
communicated
a
piece
of
news
to
her
sister
which
in
spite
of
all
that
she
knew
before
of
marianne
s
imprudence
and
want
of
thought
surprised
her
by
its
extravagant
testimony
of
both
marianne
told
her
with
the
greatest
delight
that
willoughby
had
given
her
a
horse
one
that
he
had
bred
himself
on
his
estate
in
somersetshire
and
which
was
exactly
calculated
to
carry
a
woman
without
considering
that
it
was
not
in
her
mother
s
plan
to
keep
any
horse
that
if
she
were
to
alter
her
resolution
in
favour
of
this
gift
she
must
buy
another
for
the
servant
and
keep
a
servant
to
ride
it
and
after
all
build
a
stable
to
receive
them
she
had
accepted
the
present
without
hesitation
and
told
her
sister
of
it
in
raptures
he
intends
to
send
his
groom
into
somersetshire
immediately
for
it
she
added
and
when
it
arrives
we
will
ride
every
day
you
shall
share
its
use
with
me
imagine
to
yourself
my
dear
elinor
the
delight
of
a
gallop
on
some
of
these
downs
most
unwilling
was
she
to
awaken
from
such
a
dream
of
felicity
to
comprehend
all
the
unhappy
truths
which
attended
the
affair
and
for
some
time
she
refused
to
submit
to
them
as
to
an
additional
servant
the
expense
would
be
a
trifle
mama
she
was
sure
would
never
object
to
it
and
any
horse
would
do
for
him
he
might
always
get
one
at
the
park
as
to
a
stable
the
merest
shed
would
be
sufficient
elinor
then
ventured
to
doubt
the
propriety
of
her
receiving
such
a
present
from
a
man
so
little
or
at
least
so
lately
known
to
her
this
was
too
much
you
are
mistaken
elinor
said
she
warmly
in
supposing
i
know
very
little
of
willoughby
i
have
not
known
him
long
indeed
but
i
am
much
better
acquainted
with
him
than
i
am
with
any
other
creature
in
the
world
except
yourself
and
mama
it
is
not
time
or
opportunity
that
is
to
determine
intimacy
it
is
disposition
alone
seven
years
would
be
insufficient
to
make
some
people
acquainted
with
each
other
and
seven
days
are
more
than
enough
for
others
i
should
hold
myself
guilty
of
greater
impropriety
in
accepting
a
horse
from
my
brother
than
from
willoughby
of
john
i
know
very
little
though
we
have
lived
together
for
years
but
of
willoughby
my
judgment
has
long
been
formed
elinor
thought
it
wisest
to
touch
that
point
no
more
she
knew
her
sister
s
temper
opposition
on
so
tender
a
subject
would
only
attach
her
the
more
to
her
own
opinion
but
by
an
appeal
to
her
affection
for
her
mother
by
representing
the
inconveniences
which
that
indulgent
mother
must
draw
on
herself
if
as
would
probably
be
the
case
she
consented
to
this
increase
of
establishment
marianne
was
shortly
subdued
and
she
promised
not
to
tempt
her
mother
to
such
imprudent
kindness
by
mentioning
the
offer
and
to
tell
willoughby
when
she
saw
him
next
that
it
must
be
declined
she
was
faithful
to
her
word
and
when
willoughby
called
at
the
cottage
the
same
day
elinor
heard
her
express
her
disappointment
to
him
in
a
low
voice
on
being
obliged
to
forego
the
acceptance
of
his
present
the
reasons
for
this
alteration
were
at
the
same
time
related
and
they
were
such
as
to
make
further
entreaty
on
his
side
impossible
his
concern
however
was
very
apparent
and
after
expressing
it
with
earnestness
he
added
in
the
same
low
voice
but
marianne
the
horse
is
still
yours
though
you
cannot
use
it
now
i
shall
keep
it
only
till
you
can
claim
it
when
you
leave
barton
to
form
your
own
establishment
in
a
more
lasting
home
queen
mab
shall
receive
you
this
was
all
overheard
by
miss
dashwood
and
in
the
whole
of
the
sentence
in
his
manner
of
pronouncing
it
and
in
his
addressing
her
sister
by
her
christian
name
alone
she
instantly
saw
an
intimacy
so
decided
a
meaning
so
direct
as
marked
a
perfect
agreement
between
them
from
that
moment
she
doubted
not
of
their
being
engaged
to
each
other
and
the
belief
of
it
created
no
other
surprise
than
that
she
or
any
of
their
friends
should
be
left
by
tempers
so
frank
to
discover
it
by
accident
margaret
related
something
to
her
the
next
day
which
placed
this
matter
in
a
still
clearer
light
willoughby
had
spent
the
preceding
evening
with
them
and
margaret
by
being
left
some
time
in
the
parlour
with
only
him
and
marianne
had
had
opportunity
for
observations
which
with
a
most
important
face
she
communicated
to
her
eldest
sister
when
they
were
next
by
themselves
oh
elinor
she
cried
i
have
such
a
secret
to
tell
you
about
marianne
i
am
sure
she
will
be
married
to
mr
willoughby
very
soon
you
have
said
so
replied
elinor
almost
every
day
since
they
first
met
on
high
church
down
and
they
had
not
known
each
other
a
week
i
believe
before
you
were
certain
that
marianne
wore
his
picture
round
her
neck
but
it
turned
out
to
be
only
the
miniature
of
our
great
uncle
but
indeed
this
is
quite
another
thing
i
am
sure
they
will
be
married
very
soon
for
he
has
got
a
lock
of
her
hair
take
care
margaret
it
may
be
only
the
hair
of
some
great
uncle
of
his
but
indeed
elinor
it
is
marianne
s
i
am
almost
sure
it
is
for
i
saw
him
cut
it
off
last
night
after
tea
when
you
and
mama
went
out
of
the
room
they
were
whispering
and
talking
together
as
fast
as
could
be
and
he
seemed
to
be
begging
something
of
her
and
presently
he
took
up
her
scissors
and
cut
off
a
long
lock
of
her
hair
for
it
was
all
tumbled
down
her
back
and
he
kissed
it
and
folded
it
up
in
a
piece
of
white
paper
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
book
for
such
particulars
stated
on
such
authority
elinor
could
not
withhold
her
credit
nor
was
she
disposed
to
it
for
the
circumstance
was
in
perfect
unison
with
what
she
had
heard
and
seen
herself
margaret
s
sagacity
was
not
always
displayed
in
a
way
so
satisfactory
to
her
sister
when
mrs
jennings
attacked
her
one
evening
at
the
park
to
give
the
name
of
the
young
man
who
was
elinor
s
particular
favourite
which
had
been
long
a
matter
of
great
curiosity
to
her
margaret
answered
by
looking
at
her
sister
and
saying
i
must
not
tell
may
i
elinor
this
of
course
made
every
body
laugh
and
elinor
tried
to
laugh
too
but
the
effort
was
painful
she
was
convinced
that
margaret
had
fixed
on
a
person
whose
name
she
could
not
bear
with
composure
to
become
a
standing
joke
with
mrs
jennings
marianne
felt
for
her
most
sincerely
but
she
did
more
harm
than
good
to
the
cause
by
turning
very
red
and
saying
in
an
angry
manner
to
margaret
remember
that
whatever
your
conjectures
may
be
you
have
no
right
to
repeat
them
i
never
had
any
conjectures
about
it
replied
margaret
it
was
you
who
told
me
of
it
yourself
this
increased
the
mirth
of
the
company
and
margaret
was
eagerly
pressed
to
say
something
more
oh
pray
miss
margaret
let
us
know
all
about
it
said
mrs
jennings
what
is
the
gentleman
s
name
i
must
not
tell
ma
am
but
i
know
very
well
what
it
is
and
i
know
where
he
is
too
yes
yes
we
can
guess
where
he
is
at
his
own
house
at
norland
to
be
sure
he
is
the
curate
of
the
parish
i
dare
say
no
that
he
is
not
he
is
of
no
profession
at
all
margaret
said
marianne
with
great
warmth
you
know
that
all
this
is
an
invention
of
your
own
and
that
there
is
no
such
person
in
existence
well
then
he
is
lately
dead
marianne
for
i
am
sure
there
was
such
a
man
once
and
his
name
begins
with
an
f
most
grateful
did
elinor
feel
to
lady
middleton
for
observing
at
this
moment
that
it
rained
very
hard
though
she
believed
the
interruption
to
proceed
less
from
any
attention
to
her
than
from
her
ladyship
s
great
dislike
of
all
such
inelegant
subjects
of
raillery
as
delighted
her
husband
and
mother
the
idea
however
started
by
her
was
immediately
pursued
by
colonel
brandon
who
was
on
every
occasion
mindful
of
the
feelings
of
others
and
much
was
said
on
the
subject
of
rain
by
both
of
them
willoughby
opened
the
piano
forte
and
asked
marianne
to
sit
down
to
it
and
thus
amidst
the
various
endeavours
of
different
people
to
quit
the
topic
it
fell
to
the
ground
but
not
so
easily
did
elinor
recover
from
the
alarm
into
which
it
had
thrown
her
a
party
was
formed
this
evening
for
going
on
the
following
day
to
see
a
very
fine
place
about
twelve
miles
from
barton
belonging
to
a
brother
in
law
of
colonel
brandon
without
whose
interest
it
could
not
be
seen
as
the
proprietor
who
was
then
abroad
had
left
strict
orders
on
that
head
the
grounds
were
declared
to
be
highly
beautiful
and
sir
john
who
was
particularly
warm
in
their
praise
might
be
allowed
to
be
a
tolerable
judge
for
he
had
formed
parties
to
visit
them
at
least
twice
every
summer
for
the
last
ten
years
they
contained
a
noble
piece
of
water
a
sail
on
which
was
to
a
form
a
great
part
of
the
morning
s
amusement
cold
provisions
were
to
be
taken
open
carriages
only
to
be
employed
and
every
thing
conducted
in
the
usual
style
of
a
complete
party
of
pleasure
to
some
few
of
the
company
it
appeared
rather
a
bold
undertaking
considering
the
time
of
year
and
that
it
had
rained
every
day
for
the
last
fortnight
and
mrs
dashwood
who
had
already
a
cold
was
persuaded
by
elinor
to
stay
at
home
their
intended
excursion
to
whitwell
turned
out
very
different
from
what
elinor
had
expected
she
was
prepared
to
be
wet
through
fatigued
and
frightened
but
the
event
was
still
more
unfortunate
for
they
did
not
go
at
all
by
ten
o
clock
the
whole
party
was
assembled
at
the
park
where
they
were
to
breakfast
the
morning
was
rather
favourable
though
it
had
rained
all
night
as
the
clouds
were
then
dispersing
across
the
sky
and
the
sun
frequently
appeared
they
were
all
in
high
spirits
and
good
humour
eager
to
be
happy
and
determined
to
submit
to
the
greatest
inconveniences
and
hardships
rather
than
be
otherwise
while
they
were
at
breakfast
the
letters
were
brought
in
among
the
rest
there
was
one
for
colonel
brandon
he
took
it
looked
at
the
direction
changed
colour
and
immediately
left
the
room
what
is
the
matter
with
brandon
said
sir
john
nobody
could
tell
i
hope
he
has
had
no
bad
news
said
lady
middleton
it
must
be
something
extraordinary
that
could
make
colonel
brandon
leave
my
breakfast
table
so
suddenly
in
about
five
minutes
he
returned
no
bad
news
colonel
i
hope
said
mrs
jennings
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
room
none
at
all
ma
am
i
thank
you
was
it
from
avignon
i
hope
it
is
not
to
say
that
your
sister
is
worse
no
ma
am
it
came
from
town
and
is
merely
a
letter
of
business
but
how
came
the
hand
to
discompose
you
so
much
if
it
was
only
a
letter
of
business
come
come
this
won
t
do
colonel
so
let
us
hear
the
truth
of
it
my
dear
madam
said
lady
middleton
recollect
what
you
are
saying
perhaps
it
is
to
tell
you
that
your
cousin
fanny
is
married
said
mrs
jennings
without
attending
to
her
daughter
s
reproof
no
indeed
it
is
not
well
then
i
know
who
it
is
from
colonel
and
i
hope
she
is
well
whom
do
you
mean
ma
am
said
he
colouring
a
little
oh
you
know
who
i
mean
i
am
particularly
sorry
ma
am
said
he
addressing
lady
middleton
that
i
should
receive
this
letter
today
for
it
is
on
business
which
requires
my
immediate
attendance
in
town
in
town
cried
mrs
jennings
what
can
you
have
to
do
in
town
at
this
time
of
year
my
own
loss
is
great
he
continued
in
being
obliged
to
leave
so
agreeable
a
party
but
i
am
the
more
concerned
as
i
fear
my
presence
is
necessary
to
gain
your
admittance
at
whitwell
what
a
blow
upon
them
all
was
this
but
if
you
write
a
note
to
the
housekeeper
mr
brandon
said
marianne
eagerly
will
it
not
be
sufficient
he
shook
his
head
we
must
go
said
sir
john
it
shall
not
be
put
off
when
we
are
so
near
it
you
cannot
go
to
town
till
tomorrow
brandon
that
is
all
i
wish
it
could
be
so
easily
settled
but
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
delay
my
journey
for
one
day
if
you
would
but
let
us
know
what
your
business
is
said
mrs
jennings
we
might
see
whether
it
could
be
put
off
or
not
you
would
not
be
six
hours
later
said
willoughby
if
you
were
to
defer
your
journey
till
our
return
i
cannot
afford
to
lose
one
hour
elinor
then
heard
willoughby
say
in
a
low
voice
to
marianne
there
are
some
people
who
cannot
bear
a
party
of
pleasure
brandon
is
one
of
them
he
was
afraid
of
catching
cold
i
dare
say
and
invented
this
trick
for
getting
out
of
it
i
would
lay
fifty
guineas
the
letter
was
of
his
own
writing
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
replied
marianne
there
is
no
persuading
you
to
change
your
mind
brandon
i
know
of
old
said
sir
john
when
once
you
are
determined
on
anything
but
however
i
hope
you
will
think
better
of
it
consider
here
are
the
two
miss
careys
come
over
from
newton
the
three
miss
dashwoods
walked
up
from
the
cottage
and
mr
willoughby
got
up
two
hours
before
his
usual
time
on
purpose
to
go
to
whitwell
colonel
brandon
again
repeated
his
sorrow
at
being
the
cause
of
disappointing
the
party
but
at
the
same
time
declared
it
to
be
unavoidable
well
then
when
will
you
come
back
again
i
hope
we
shall
see
you
at
barton
added
her
ladyship
as
soon
as
you
can
conveniently
leave
town
and
we
must
put
off
the
party
to
whitwell
till
you
return
you
are
very
obliging
but
it
is
so
uncertain
when
i
may
have
it
in
my
power
to
return
that
i
dare
not
engage
for
it
at
all
oh
he
must
and
shall
come
back
cried
sir
john
if
he
is
not
here
by
the
end
of
the
week
i
shall
go
after
him
ay
so
do
sir
john
cried
mrs
jennings
and
then
perhaps
you
may
find
out
what
his
business
is
i
do
not
want
to
pry
into
other
men
s
concerns
i
suppose
it
is
something
he
is
ashamed
of
colonel
brandon
s
horses
were
announced
you
do
not
go
to
town
on
horseback
do
you
added
sir
john
no
only
to
honiton
i
shall
then
go
post
well
as
you
are
resolved
to
go
i
wish
you
a
good
journey
but
you
had
better
change
your
mind
i
assure
you
it
is
not
in
my
power
he
then
took
leave
of
the
whole
party
is
there
no
chance
of
my
seeing
you
and
your
sisters
in
town
this
winter
miss
dashwood
i
am
afraid
none
at
all
then
i
must
bid
you
farewell
for
a
longer
time
than
i
should
wish
to
do
to
marianne
he
merely
bowed
and
said
nothing
come
colonel
said
mrs
jennings
before
you
go
do
let
us
know
what
you
are
going
about
he
wished
her
a
good
morning
and
attended
by
sir
john
left
the
room
the
complaints
and
lamentations
which
politeness
had
hitherto
restrained
now
burst
forth
universally
and
they
all
agreed
again
and
again
how
provoking
it
was
to
be
so
disappointed
i
can
guess
what
his
business
is
however
said
mrs
jennings
exultingly
can
you
ma
am
said
almost
every
body
yes
it
is
about
miss
williams
i
am
sure
and
who
is
miss
williams
asked
marianne
what
do
not
you
know
who
miss
williams
is
i
am
sure
you
must
have
heard
of
her
before
she
is
a
relation
of
the
colonel
s
my
dear
a
very
near
relation
we
will
not
say
how
near
for
fear
of
shocking
the
young
ladies
then
lowering
her
voice
a
little
she
said
to
elinor
she
is
his
natural
daughter
indeed
oh
yes
and
as
like
him
as
she
can
stare
i
dare
say
the
colonel
will
leave
her
all
his
fortune
when
sir
john
returned
he
joined
most
heartily
in
the
general
regret
on
so
unfortunate
an
event
concluding
however
by
observing
that
as
they
were
all
got
together
they
must
do
something
by
way
of
being
happy
and
after
some
consultation
it
was
agreed
that
although
happiness
could
only
be
enjoyed
at
whitwell
they
might
procure
a
tolerable
composure
of
mind
by
driving
about
the
country
the
carriages
were
then
ordered
willoughby
s
was
first
and
marianne
never
looked
happier
than
when
she
got
into
it
he
drove
through
the
park
very
fast
and
they
were
soon
out
of
sight
and
nothing
more
of
them
was
seen
till
their
return
which
did
not
happen
till
after
the
return
of
all
the
rest
they
both
seemed
delighted
with
their
drive
but
said
only
in
general
terms
that
they
had
kept
in
the
lanes
while
the
others
went
on
the
downs
it
was
settled
that
there
should
be
a
dance
in
the
evening
and
that
every
body
should
be
extremely
merry
all
day
long
some
more
of
the
careys
came
to
dinner
and
they
had
the
pleasure
of
sitting
down
nearly
twenty
to
table
which
sir
john
observed
with
great
contentment
willoughby
took
his
usual
place
between
the
two
elder
miss
dashwoods
mrs
jennings
sat
on
elinor
s
right
hand
and
they
had
not
been
long
seated
before
she
leant
behind
her
and
willoughby
and
said
to
marianne
loud
enough
for
them
both
to
hear
i
have
found
you
out
in
spite
of
all
your
tricks
i
know
where
you
spent
the
morning
marianne
coloured
and
replied
very
hastily
where
pray
did
not
you
know
said
willoughby
that
we
had
been
out
in
my
curricle
yes
yes
mr
impudence
i
know
that
very
well
and
i
was
determined
to
find
out
where
you
had
been
to
i
hope
you
like
your
house
miss
marianne
it
is
a
very
large
one
i
know
and
when
i
come
to
see
you
i
hope
you
will
have
new
furnished
it
for
it
wanted
it
very
much
when
i
was
there
six
years
ago
marianne
turned
away
in
great
confusion
mrs
jennings
laughed
heartily
and
elinor
found
that
in
her
resolution
to
know
where
they
had
been
she
had
actually
made
her
own
woman
enquire
of
mr
willoughby
s
groom
and
that
she
had
by
that
method
been
informed
that
they
had
gone
to
allenham
and
spent
a
considerable
time
there
in
walking
about
the
garden
and
going
all
over
the
house
elinor
could
hardly
believe
this
to
be
true
as
it
seemed
very
unlikely
that
willoughby
should
propose
or
marianne
consent
to
enter
the
house
while
mrs
smith
was
in
it
with
whom
marianne
had
not
the
smallest
acquaintance
as
soon
as
they
left
the
dining
room
elinor
enquired
of
her
about
it
and
great
was
her
surprise
when
she
found
that
every
circumstance
related
by
mrs
jennings
was
perfectly
true
marianne
was
quite
angry
with
her
for
doubting
it
why
should
you
imagine
elinor
that
we
did
not
go
there
or
that
we
did
not
see
the
house
is
not
it
what
you
have
often
wished
to
do
yourself
yes
marianne
but
i
would
not
go
while
mrs
smith
was
there
and
with
no
other
companion
than
mr
willoughby
mr
willoughby
however
is
the
only
person
who
can
have
a
right
to
shew
that
house
and
as
he
went
in
an
open
carriage
it
was
impossible
to
have
any
other
companion
i
never
spent
a
pleasanter
morning
in
my
life
i
am
afraid
replied
elinor
that
the
pleasantness
of
an
employment
does
not
always
evince
its
propriety
on
the
contrary
nothing
can
be
a
stronger
proof
of
it
elinor
for
if
there
had
been
any
real
impropriety
in
what
i
did
i
should
have
been
sensible
of
it
at
the
time
for
we
always
know
when
we
are
acting
wrong
and
with
such
a
conviction
i
could
have
had
no
pleasure
but
my
dear
marianne
as
it
has
already
exposed
you
to
some
very
impertinent
remarks
do
you
not
now
begin
to
doubt
the
discretion
of
your
own
conduct
if
the
impertinent
remarks
of
mrs
jennings
are
to
be
the
proof
of
impropriety
in
conduct
we
are
all
offending
every
moment
of
our
lives
i
value
not
her
censure
any
more
than
i
should
do
her
commendation
i
am
not
sensible
of
having
done
anything
wrong
in
walking
over
mrs
smith
s
grounds
or
in
seeing
her
house
they
will
one
day
be
mr
willoughby
s
and
if
they
were
one
day
to
be
your
own
marianne
you
would
not
be
justified
in
what
you
have
done
she
blushed
at
this
hint
but
it
was
even
visibly
gratifying
to
her
and
after
a
ten
minutes
interval
of
earnest
thought
she
came
to
her
sister
again
and
said
with
great
good
humour
perhaps
elinor
it
was
rather
ill
judged
in
me
to
go
to
allenham
but
mr
willoughby
wanted
particularly
to
shew
me
the
place
and
it
is
a
charming
house
i
assure
you
there
is
one
remarkably
pretty
sitting
room
up
stairs
of
a
nice
comfortable
size
for
constant
use
and
with
modern
furniture
it
would
be
delightful
it
is
a
corner
room
and
has
windows
on
two
sides
on
one
side
you
look
across
the
bowling
green
behind
the
house
to
a
beautiful
hanging
wood
and
on
the
other
you
have
a
view
of
the
church
and
village
and
beyond
them
of
those
fine
bold
hills
that
we
have
so
often
admired
i
did
not
see
it
to
advantage
for
nothing
could
be
more
forlorn
than
the
furniture
but
if
it
were
newly
fitted
up
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
willoughby
says
would
make
it
one
of
the
pleasantest
summer
rooms
in
england
could
elinor
have
listened
to
her
without
interruption
from
the
others
she
would
have
described
every
room
in
the
house
with
equal
delight
the
sudden
termination
of
colonel
brandon
s
visit
at
the
park
with
his
steadiness
in
concealing
its
cause
filled
the
mind
and
raised
the
wonder
of
mrs
jennings
for
two
or
three
days
she
was
a
great
wonderer
as
every
one
must
be
who
takes
a
very
lively
interest
in
all
the
comings
and
goings
of
all
their
acquaintance
she
wondered
with
little
intermission
what
could
be
the
reason
of
it
was
sure
there
must
be
some
bad
news
and
thought
over
every
kind
of
distress
that
could
have
befallen
him
with
a
fixed
determination
that
he
should
not
escape
them
all
something
very
melancholy
must
be
the
matter
i
am
sure
said
she
i
could
see
it
in
his
face
poor
man
i
am
afraid
his
circumstances
may
be
bad
the
estate
at
delaford
was
never
reckoned
more
than
two
thousand
a
year
and
his
brother
left
everything
sadly
involved
i
do
think
he
must
have
been
sent
for
about
money
matters
for
what
else
can
it
be
i
wonder
whether
it
is
so
i
would
give
anything
to
know
the
truth
of
it
perhaps
it
is
about
miss
williams
and
by
the
bye
i
dare
say
it
is
because
he
looked
so
conscious
when
i
mentioned
her
may
be
she
is
ill
in
town
nothing
in
the
world
more
likely
for
i
have
a
notion
she
is
always
rather
sickly
i
would
lay
any
wager
it
is
about
miss
williams
it
is
not
so
very
likely
he
should
be
distressed
in
his
circumstances
now
for
he
is
a
very
prudent
man
and
to
be
sure
must
have
cleared
the
estate
by
this
time
i
wonder
what
it
can
be
may
be
his
sister
is
worse
at
avignon
and
has
sent
for
him
over
his
setting
off
in
such
a
hurry
seems
very
like
it
well
i
wish
him
out
of
all
his
trouble
with
all
my
heart
and
a
good
wife
into
the
bargain
so
wondered
so
talked
mrs
jennings
her
opinion
varying
with
every
fresh
conjecture
and
all
seeming
equally
probable
as
they
arose
elinor
though
she
felt
really
interested
in
the
welfare
of
colonel
brandon
could
not
bestow
all
the
wonder
on
his
going
so
suddenly
away
which
mrs
jennings
was
desirous
of
her
feeling
for
besides
that
the
circumstance
did
not
in
her
opinion
justify
such
lasting
amazement
or
variety
of
speculation
her
wonder
was
otherwise
disposed
of
it
was
engrossed
by
the
extraordinary
silence
of
her
sister
and
willoughby
on
the
subject
which
they
must
know
to
be
peculiarly
interesting
to
them
all
as
this
silence
continued
every
day
made
it
appear
more
strange
and
more
incompatible
with
the
disposition
of
both
why
they
should
not
openly
acknowledge
to
her
mother
and
herself
what
their
constant
behaviour
to
each
other
declared
to
have
taken
place
elinor
could
not
imagine
she
could
easily
conceive
that
marriage
might
not
be
immediately
in
their
power
for
though
willoughby
was
independent
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
him
rich
his
estate
had
been
rated
by
sir
john
at
about
six
or
seven
hundred
a
year
but
he
lived
at
an
expense
to
which
that
income
could
hardly
be
equal
and
he
had
himself
often
complained
of
his
poverty
but
for
this
strange
kind
of
secrecy
maintained
by
them
relative
to
their
engagement
which
in
fact
concealed
nothing
at
all
she
could
not
account
and
it
was
so
wholly
contradictory
to
their
general
opinions
and
practice
that
a
doubt
sometimes
entered
her
mind
of
their
being
really
engaged
and
this
doubt
was
enough
to
prevent
her
making
any
inquiry
of
marianne
nothing
could
be
more
expressive
of
attachment
to
them
all
than
willoughby
s
behaviour
to
marianne
it
had
all
the
distinguishing
tenderness
which
a
lover
s
heart
could
give
and
to
the
rest
of
the
family
it
was
the
affectionate
attention
of
a
son
and
a
brother
the
cottage
seemed
to
be
considered
and
loved
by
him
as
his
home
many
more
of
his
hours
were
spent
there
than
at
allenham
and
if
no
general
engagement
collected
them
at
the
park
the
exercise
which
called
him
out
in
the
morning
was
almost
certain
of
ending
there
where
the
rest
of
the
day
was
spent
by
himself
at
the
side
of
marianne
and
by
his
favourite
pointer
at
her
feet
one
evening
in
particular
about
a
week
after
colonel
brandon
left
the
country
his
heart
seemed
more
than
usually
open
to
every
feeling
of
attachment
to
the
objects
around
him
and
on
mrs
dashwood
s
happening
to
mention
her
design
of
improving
the
cottage
in
the
spring
he
warmly
opposed
every
alteration
of
a
place
which
affection
had
established
as
perfect
with
him
what
he
exclaimed
improve
this
dear
cottage
no
that
i
will
never
consent
to
not
a
stone
must
be
added
to
its
walls
not
an
inch
to
its
size
if
my
feelings
are
regarded
do
not
be
alarmed
said
miss
dashwood
nothing
of
the
kind
will
be
done
for
my
mother
will
never
have
money
enough
to
attempt
it
i
am
heartily
glad
of
it
he
cried
may
she
always
be
poor
if
she
can
employ
her
riches
no
better
thank
you
willoughby
but
you
may
be
assured
that
i
would
not
sacrifice
one
sentiment
of
local
attachment
of
yours
or
of
any
one
whom
i
loved
for
all
the
improvements
in
the
world
depend
upon
it
that
whatever
unemployed
sum
may
remain
when
i
make
up
my
accounts
in
the
spring
i
would
even
rather
lay
it
uselessly
by
than
dispose
of
it
in
a
manner
so
painful
to
you
but
are
you
really
so
attached
to
this
place
as
to
see
no
defect
in
it
i
am
said
he
to
me
it
is
faultless
nay
more
i
consider
it
as
the
only
form
of
building
in
which
happiness
is
attainable
and
were
i
rich
enough
i
would
instantly
pull
combe
down
and
build
it
up
again
in
the
exact
plan
of
this
cottage
with
dark
narrow
stairs
and
a
kitchen
that
smokes
i
suppose
said
elinor
yes
cried
he
in
the
same
eager
tone
with
all
and
every
thing
belonging
to
it
in
no
one
convenience
or
inconvenience
about
it
should
the
least
variation
be
perceptible
then
and
then
only
under
such
a
roof
i
might
perhaps
be
as
happy
at
combe
as
i
have
been
at
barton
i
flatter
myself
replied
elinor
that
even
under
the
disadvantage
of
better
rooms
and
a
broader
staircase
you
will
hereafter
find
your
own
house
as
faultless
as
you
now
do
this
there
certainly
are
circumstances
said
willoughby
which
might
greatly
endear
it
to
me
but
this
place
will
always
have
one
claim
of
my
affection
which
no
other
can
possibly
share
mrs
dashwood
looked
with
pleasure
at
marianne
whose
fine
eyes
were
fixed
so
expressively
on
willoughby
as
plainly
denoted
how
well
she
understood
him
how
often
did
i
wish
added
he
when
i
was
at
allenham
this
time
twelvemonth
that
barton
cottage
were
inhabited
i
never
passed
within
view
of
it
without
admiring
its
situation
and
grieving
that
no
one
should
live
in
it
how
little
did
i
then
think
that
the
very
first
news
i
should
hear
from
mrs
smith
when
i
next
came
into
the
country
would
be
that
barton
cottage
was
taken
and
i
felt
an
immediate
satisfaction
and
interest
in
the
event
which
nothing
but
a
kind
of
prescience
of
what
happiness
i
should
experience
from
it
can
account
for
must
it
not
have
been
so
marianne
speaking
to
her
in
a
lowered
voice
then
continuing
his
former
tone
he
said
and
yet
this
house
you
would
spoil
mrs
dashwood
you
would
rob
it
of
its
simplicity
by
imaginary
improvement
and
this
dear
parlour
in
which
our
acquaintance
first
began
and
in
which
so
many
happy
hours
have
been
since
spent
by
us
together
you
would
degrade
to
the
condition
of
a
common
entrance
and
every
body
would
be
eager
to
pass
through
the
room
which
has
hitherto
contained
within
itself
more
real
accommodation
and
comfort
than
any
other
apartment
of
the
handsomest
dimensions
in
the
world
could
possibly
afford
mrs
dashwood
again
assured
him
that
no
alteration
of
the
kind
should
be
attempted
you
are
a
good
woman
he
warmly
replied
your
promise
makes
me
easy
extend
it
a
little
farther
and
it
will
make
me
happy
tell
me
that
not
only
your
house
will
remain
the
same
but
that
i
shall
ever
find
you
and
yours
as
unchanged
as
your
dwelling
and
that
you
will
always
consider
me
with
the
kindness
which
has
made
everything
belonging
to
you
so
dear
to
me
the
promise
was
readily
given
and
willoughby
s
behaviour
during
the
whole
of
the
evening
declared
at
once
his
affection
and
happiness
shall
we
see
you
tomorrow
to
dinner
said
mrs
dashwood
when
he
was
leaving
them
i
do
not
ask
you
to
come
in
the
morning
for
we
must
walk
to
the
park
to
call
on
lady
middleton
he
engaged
to
be
with
them
by
four
o
clock
mrs
dashwood
s
visit
to
lady
middleton
took
place
the
next
day
and
two
of
her
daughters
went
with
her
but
marianne
excused
herself
from
being
of
the
party
under
some
trifling
pretext
of
employment
and
her
mother
who
concluded
that
a
promise
had
been
made
by
willoughby
the
night
before
of
calling
on
her
while
they
were
absent
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
her
remaining
at
home
on
their
return
from
the
park
they
found
willoughby
s
curricle
and
servant
in
waiting
at
the
cottage
and
mrs
dashwood
was
convinced
that
her
conjecture
had
been
just
so
far
it
was
all
as
she
had
foreseen
but
on
entering
the
house
she
beheld
what
no
foresight
had
taught
her
to
expect
they
were
no
sooner
in
the
passage
than
marianne
came
hastily
out
of
the
parlour
apparently
in
violent
affliction
with
her
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
and
without
noticing
them
ran
up
stairs
surprised
and
alarmed
they
proceeded
directly
into
the
room
she
had
just
quitted
where
they
found
only
willoughby
who
was
leaning
against
the
mantel
piece
with
his
back
towards
them
he
turned
round
on
their
coming
in
and
his
countenance
shewed
that
he
strongly
partook
of
the
emotion
which
over
powered
marianne
is
anything
the
matter
with
her
cried
mrs
dashwood
as
she
entered
is
she
ill
i
hope
not
he
replied
trying
to
look
cheerful
and
with
a
forced
smile
presently
added
it
is
i
who
may
rather
expect
to
be
ill
for
i
am
now
suffering
under
a
very
heavy
disappointment
disappointment
yes
for
i
am
unable
to
keep
my
engagement
with
you
mrs
smith
has
this
morning
exercised
the
privilege
of
riches
upon
a
poor
dependent
cousin
by
sending
me
on
business
to
london
i
have
just
received
my
dispatches
and
taken
my
farewell
of
allenham
and
by
way
of
exhilaration
i
am
now
come
to
take
my
farewell
of
you
to
london
and
are
you
going
this
morning
almost
this
moment
this
is
very
unfortunate
but
mrs
smith
must
be
obliged
and
her
business
will
not
detain
you
from
us
long
i
hope
he
coloured
as
he
replied
you
are
very
kind
but
i
have
no
idea
of
returning
into
devonshire
immediately
my
visits
to
mrs
smith
are
never
repeated
within
the
twelvemonth
and
is
mrs
smith
your
only
friend
is
allenham
the
only
house
in
the
neighbourhood
to
which
you
will
be
welcome
for
shame
willoughby
can
you
wait
for
an
invitation
here
his
colour
increased
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
he
only
replied
you
are
too
good
mrs
dashwood
looked
at
elinor
with
surprise
elinor
felt
equal
amazement
for
a
few
moments
every
one
was
silent
mrs
dashwood
first
spoke
i
have
only
to
add
my
dear
willoughby
that
at
barton
cottage
you
will
always
be
welcome
for
i
will
not
press
you
to
return
here
immediately
because
you
only
can
judge
how
far
that
might
be
pleasing
to
mrs
smith
and
on
this
head
i
shall
be
no
more
disposed
to
question
your
judgment
than
to
doubt
your
inclination
my
engagements
at
present
replied
willoughby
confusedly
are
of
such
a
nature
that
i
dare
not
flatter
myself
he
stopt
mrs
dashwood
was
too
much
astonished
to
speak
and
another
pause
succeeded
this
was
broken
by
willoughby
who
said
with
a
faint
smile
it
is
folly
to
linger
in
this
manner
i
will
not
torment
myself
any
longer
by
remaining
among
friends
whose
society
it
is
impossible
for
me
now
to
enjoy
he
then
hastily
took
leave
of
them
all
and
left
the
room
they
saw
him
step
into
his
carriage
and
in
a
minute
it
was
out
of
sight
mrs
dashwood
felt
too
much
for
speech
and
instantly
quitted
the
parlour
to
give
way
in
solitude
to
the
concern
and
alarm
which
this
sudden
departure
occasioned
elinor
s
uneasiness
was
at
least
equal
to
her
mother
s
she
thought
of
what
had
just
passed
with
anxiety
and
distrust
willoughby
s
behaviour
in
taking
leave
of
them
his
embarrassment
and
affectation
of
cheerfulness
and
above
all
his
unwillingness
to
accept
her
mother
s
invitation
a
backwardness
so
unlike
a
lover
so
unlike
himself
greatly
disturbed
her
one
moment
she
feared
that
no
serious
design
had
ever
been
formed
on
his
side
and
the
next
that
some
unfortunate
quarrel
had
taken
place
between
him
and
her
sister
the
distress
in
which
marianne
had
quitted
the
room
was
such
as
a
serious
quarrel
could
most
reasonably
account
for
though
when
she
considered
what
marianne
s
love
for
him
was
a
quarrel
seemed
almost
impossible
but
whatever
might
be
the
particulars
of
their
separation
her
sister
s
affliction
was
indubitable
and
she
thought
with
the
tenderest
compassion
of
that
violent
sorrow
which
marianne
was
in
all
probability
not
merely
giving
way
to
as
a
relief
but
feeding
and
encouraging
as
a
duty
in
about
half
an
hour
her
mother
returned
and
though
her
eyes
were
red
her
countenance
was
not
uncheerful
our
dear
willoughby
is
now
some
miles
from
barton
elinor
said
she
as
she
sat
down
to
work
and
with
how
heavy
a
heart
does
he
travel
it
is
all
very
strange
so
suddenly
to
be
gone
it
seems
but
the
work
of
a
moment
and
last
night
he
was
with
us
so
happy
so
cheerful
so
affectionate
and
now
after
only
ten
minutes
notice
gone
too
without
intending
to
return
something
more
than
what
he
owned
to
us
must
have
happened
he
did
not
speak
he
did
not
behave
like
himself
you
must
have
seen
the
difference
as
well
as
i
what
can
it
be
can
they
have
quarrelled
why
else
should
he
have
shewn
such
unwillingness
to
accept
your
invitation
here
it
was
not
inclination
that
he
wanted
elinor
i
could
plainly
see
that
he
had
not
the
power
of
accepting
it
i
have
thought
it
all
over
i
assure
you
and
i
can
perfectly
account
for
every
thing
that
at
first
seemed
strange
to
me
as
well
as
to
you
can
you
indeed
yes
i
have
explained
it
to
myself
in
the
most
satisfactory
way
but
you
elinor
who
love
to
doubt
where
you
can
it
will
not
satisfy
you
i
know
but
you
shall
not
talk
me
out
of
my
trust
in
it
i
am
persuaded
that
mrs
smith
suspects
his
regard
for
marianne
disapproves
of
it
perhaps
because
she
has
other
views
for
him
and
on
that
account
is
eager
to
get
him
away
and
that
the
business
which
she
sends
him
off
to
transact
is
invented
as
an
excuse
to
dismiss
him
this
is
what
i
believe
to
have
happened
he
is
moreover
aware
that
she
does
disapprove
the
connection
he
dares
not
therefore
at
present
confess
to
her
his
engagement
with
marianne
and
he
feels
himself
obliged
from
his
dependent
situation
to
give
into
her
schemes
and
absent
himself
from
devonshire
for
a
while
you
will
tell
me
i
know
that
this
may
or
may
not
have
happened
but
i
will
listen
to
no
cavil
unless
you
can
point
out
any
other
method
of
understanding
the
affair
as
satisfactory
at
this
and
now
elinor
what
have
you
to
say
nothing
for
you
have
anticipated
my
answer
then
you
would
have
told
me
that
it
might
or
might
not
have
happened
oh
elinor
how
incomprehensible
are
your
feelings
you
had
rather
take
evil
upon
credit
than
good
you
had
rather
look
out
for
misery
for
marianne
and
guilt
for
poor
willoughby
than
an
apology
for
the
latter
you
are
resolved
to
think
him
blameable
because
he
took
leave
of
us
with
less
affection
than
his
usual
behaviour
has
shewn
and
is
no
allowance
to
be
made
for
inadvertence
or
for
spirits
depressed
by
recent
disappointment
are
no
probabilities
to
be
accepted
merely
because
they
are
not
certainties
is
nothing
due
to
the
man
whom
we
have
all
such
reason
to
love
and
no
reason
in
the
world
to
think
ill
of
to
the
possibility
of
motives
unanswerable
in
themselves
though
unavoidably
secret
for
a
while
and
after
all
what
is
it
you
suspect
him
of
i
can
hardly
tell
myself
but
suspicion
of
something
unpleasant
is
the
inevitable
consequence
of
such
an
alteration
as
we
just
witnessed
in
him
there
is
great
truth
however
in
what
you
have
now
urged
of
the
allowances
which
ought
to
be
made
for
him
and
it
is
my
wish
to
be
candid
in
my
judgment
of
every
body
willoughby
may
undoubtedly
have
very
sufficient
reasons
for
his
conduct
and
i
will
hope
that
he
has
but
it
would
have
been
more
like
willoughby
to
acknowledge
them
at
once
secrecy
may
be
advisable
but
still
i
cannot
help
wondering
at
its
being
practiced
by
him
do
not
blame
him
however
for
departing
from
his
character
where
the
deviation
is
necessary
but
you
really
do
admit
the
justice
of
what
i
have
said
in
his
defence
i
am
happy
and
he
is
acquitted
not
entirely
it
may
be
proper
to
conceal
their
engagement
if
they
are
engaged
from
mrs
smith
and
if
that
is
the
case
it
must
be
highly
expedient
for
willoughby
to
be
but
little
in
devonshire
at
present
but
this
is
no
excuse
for
their
concealing
it
from
us
concealing
it
from
us
my
dear
child
do
you
accuse
willoughby
and
marianne
of
concealment
this
is
strange
indeed
when
your
eyes
have
been
reproaching
them
every
day
for
incautiousness
i
want
no
proof
of
their
affection
said
elinor
but
of
their
engagement
i
do
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
of
both
yet
not
a
syllable
has
been
said
to
you
on
the
subject
by
either
of
them
i
have
not
wanted
syllables
where
actions
have
spoken
so
plainly
has
not
his
behaviour
to
marianne
and
to
all
of
us
for
at
least
the
last
fortnight
declared
that
he
loved
and
considered
her
as
his
future
wife
and
that
he
felt
for
us
the
attachment
of
the
nearest
relation
have
we
not
perfectly
understood
each
other
has
not
my
consent
been
daily
asked
by
his
looks
his
manner
his
attentive
and
affectionate
respect
my
elinor
is
it
possible
to
doubt
their
engagement
how
could
such
a
thought
occur
to
you
how
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
willoughby
persuaded
as
he
must
be
of
your
sister
s
love
should
leave
her
and
leave
her
perhaps
for
months
without
telling
her
of
his
affection
that
they
should
part
without
a
mutual
exchange
of
confidence
i
confess
replied
elinor
that
every
circumstance
except
one
is
in
favour
of
their
engagement
but
that
one
is
the
total
silence
of
both
on
the
subject
and
with
me
it
almost
outweighs
every
other
how
strange
this
is
you
must
think
wretchedly
indeed
of
willoughby
if
after
all
that
has
openly
passed
between
them
you
can
doubt
the
nature
of
the
terms
on
which
they
are
together
has
he
been
acting
a
part
in
his
behaviour
to
your
sister
all
this
time
do
you
suppose
him
really
indifferent
to
her
no
i
cannot
think
that
he
must
and
does
love
her
i
am
sure
but
with
a
strange
kind
of
tenderness
if
he
can
leave
her
with
such
indifference
such
carelessness
of
the
future
as
you
attribute
to
him
you
must
remember
my
dear
mother
that
i
have
never
considered
this
matter
as
certain
i
have
had
my
doubts
i
confess
but
they
are
fainter
than
they
were
and
they
may
soon
be
entirely
done
away
if
we
find
they
correspond
every
fear
of
mine
will
be
removed
a
mighty
concession
indeed
if
you
were
to
see
them
at
the
altar
you
would
suppose
they
were
going
to
be
married
ungracious
girl
but
i
require
no
such
proof
nothing
in
my
opinion
has
ever
passed
to
justify
doubt
no
secrecy
has
been
attempted
all
has
been
uniformly
open
and
unreserved
you
cannot
doubt
your
sister
s
wishes
it
must
be
willoughby
therefore
whom
you
suspect
but
why
is
he
not
a
man
of
honour
and
feeling
has
there
been
any
inconsistency
on
his
side
to
create
alarm
can
he
be
deceitful
i
hope
not
i
believe
not
cried
elinor
i
love
willoughby
sincerely
love
him
and
suspicion
of
his
integrity
cannot
be
more
painful
to
yourself
than
to
me
it
has
been
involuntary
and
i
will
not
encourage
it
i
was
startled
i
confess
by
the
alteration
in
his
manners
this
morning
he
did
not
speak
like
himself
and
did
not
return
your
kindness
with
any
cordiality
but
all
this
may
be
explained
by
such
a
situation
of
his
affairs
as
you
have
supposed
he
had
just
parted
from
my
sister
had
seen
her
leave
him
in
the
greatest
affliction
and
if
he
felt
obliged
from
a
fear
of
offending
mrs
smith
to
resist
the
temptation
of
returning
here
soon
and
yet
aware
that
by
declining
your
invitation
by
saying
that
he
was
going
away
for
some
time
he
should
seem
to
act
an
ungenerous
a
suspicious
part
by
our
family
he
might
well
be
embarrassed
and
disturbed
in
such
a
case
a
plain
and
open
avowal
of
his
difficulties
would
have
been
more
to
his
honour
i
think
as
well
as
more
consistent
with
his
general
character
but
i
will
not
raise
objections
against
any
one
s
conduct
on
so
illiberal
a
foundation
as
a
difference
in
judgment
from
myself
or
a
deviation
from
what
i
may
think
right
and
consistent
you
speak
very
properly
willoughby
certainly
does
not
deserve
to
be
suspected
though
we
have
not
known
him
long
he
is
no
stranger
in
this
part
of
the
world
and
who
has
ever
spoken
to
his
disadvantage
had
he
been
in
a
situation
to
act
independently
and
marry
immediately
it
might
have
been
odd
that
he
should
leave
us
without
acknowledging
everything
to
me
at
once
but
this
is
not
the
case
it
is
an
engagement
in
some
respects
not
prosperously
begun
for
their
marriage
must
be
at
a
very
uncertain
distance
and
even
secrecy
as
far
as
it
can
be
observed
may
now
be
very
advisable
they
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
margaret
and
elinor
was
then
at
liberty
to
think
over
the
representations
of
her
mother
to
acknowledge
the
probability
of
many
and
hope
for
the
justice
of
all
they
saw
nothing
of
marianne
till
dinner
time
when
she
entered
the
room
and
took
her
place
at
the
table
without
saying
a
word
her
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
and
it
seemed
as
if
her
tears
were
even
then
restrained
with
difficulty
she
avoided
the
looks
of
them
all
could
neither
eat
nor
speak
and
after
some
time
on
her
mother
s
silently
pressing
her
hand
with
tender
compassion
her
small
degree
of
fortitude
was
quite
overcome
she
burst
into
tears
and
left
the
room
this
violent
oppression
of
spirits
continued
the
whole
evening
she
was
without
any
power
because
she
was
without
any
desire
of
command
over
herself
the
slightest
mention
of
anything
relative
to
willoughby
overpowered
her
in
an
instant
and
though
her
family
were
most
anxiously
attentive
to
her
comfort
it
was
impossible
for
them
if
they
spoke
at
all
to
keep
clear
of
every
subject
which
her
feelings
connected
with
him
marianne
would
have
thought
herself
very
inexcusable
had
she
been
able
to
sleep
at
all
the
first
night
after
parting
from
willoughby
she
would
have
been
ashamed
to
look
her
family
in
the
face
the
next
morning
had
she
not
risen
from
her
bed
in
more
need
of
repose
than
when
she
lay
down
in
it
but
the
feelings
which
made
such
composure
a
disgrace
left
her
in
no
danger
of
incurring
it
she
was
awake
the
whole
night
and
she
wept
the
greatest
part
of
it
she
got
up
with
a
headache
was
unable
to
talk
and
unwilling
to
take
any
nourishment
giving
pain
every
moment
to
her
mother
and
sisters
and
forbidding
all
attempt
at
consolation
from
either
her
sensibility
was
potent
enough
when
breakfast
was
over
she
walked
out
by
herself
and
wandered
about
the
village
of
allenham
indulging
the
recollection
of
past
enjoyment
and
crying
over
the
present
reverse
for
the
chief
of
the
morning
the
evening
passed
off
in
the
equal
indulgence
of
feeling
she
played
over
every
favourite
song
that
she
had
been
used
to
play
to
willoughby
every
air
in
which
their
voices
had
been
oftenest
joined
and
sat
at
the
instrument
gazing
on
every
line
of
music
that
he
had
written
out
for
her
till
her
heart
was
so
heavy
that
no
farther
sadness
could
be
gained
and
this
nourishment
of
grief
was
every
day
applied
she
spent
whole
hours
at
the
pianoforte
alternately
singing
and
crying
her
voice
often
totally
suspended
by
her
tears
in
books
too
as
well
as
in
music
she
courted
the
misery
which
a
contrast
between
the
past
and
present
was
certain
of
giving
she
read
nothing
but
what
they
had
been
used
to
read
together
such
violence
of
affliction
indeed
could
not
be
supported
for
ever
it
sunk
within
a
few
days
into
a
calmer
melancholy
but
these
employments
to
which
she
daily
recurred
her
solitary
walks
and
silent
meditations
still
produced
occasional
effusions
of
sorrow
as
lively
as
ever
no
letter
from
willoughby
came
and
none
seemed
expected
by
marianne
her
mother
was
surprised
and
elinor
again
became
uneasy
but
mrs
dashwood
could
find
explanations
whenever
she
wanted
them
which
at
least
satisfied
herself
remember
elinor
said
she
how
very
often
sir
john
fetches
our
letters
himself
from
the
post
and
carries
them
to
it
we
have
already
agreed
that
secrecy
may
be
necessary
and
we
must
acknowledge
that
it
could
not
be
maintained
if
their
correspondence
were
to
pass
through
sir
john
s
hands
elinor
could
not
deny
the
truth
of
this
and
she
tried
to
find
in
it
a
motive
sufficient
for
their
silence
but
there
was
one
method
so
direct
so
simple
and
in
her
opinion
so
eligible
of
knowing
the
real
state
of
the
affair
and
of
instantly
removing
all
mystery
that
she
could
not
help
suggesting
it
to
her
mother
why
do
you
not
ask
marianne
at
once
said
she
whether
she
is
or
she
is
not
engaged
to
willoughby
from
you
her
mother
and
so
kind
so
indulgent
a
mother
the
question
could
not
give
offence
it
would
be
the
natural
result
of
your
affection
for
her
she
used
to
be
all
unreserve
and
to
you
more
especially
i
would
not
ask
such
a
question
for
the
world
supposing
it
possible
that
they
are
not
engaged
what
distress
would
not
such
an
enquiry
inflict
at
any
rate
it
would
be
most
ungenerous
i
should
never
deserve
her
confidence
again
after
forcing
from
her
a
confession
of
what
is
meant
at
present
to
be
unacknowledged
to
any
one
i
know
marianne
s
heart
i
know
that
she
dearly
loves
me
and
that
i
shall
not
be
the
last
to
whom
the
affair
is
made
known
when
circumstances
make
the
revealment
of
it
eligible
i
would
not
attempt
to
force
the
confidence
of
any
one
of
a
child
much
less
because
a
sense
of
duty
would
prevent
the
denial
which
her
wishes
might
direct
elinor
thought
this
generosity
overstrained
considering
her
sister
s
youth
and
urged
the
matter
farther
but
in
vain
common
sense
common
care
common
prudence
were
all
sunk
in
mrs
dashwood
s
romantic
delicacy
it
was
several
days
before
willoughby
s
name
was
mentioned
before
marianne
by
any
of
her
family
sir
john
and
mrs
jennings
indeed
were
not
so
nice
their
witticisms
added
pain
to
many
a
painful
hour
but
one
evening
mrs
dashwood
accidentally
taking
up
a
volume
of
shakespeare
exclaimed
we
have
never
finished
hamlet
marianne
our
dear
willoughby
went
away
before
we
could
get
through
it
we
will
put
it
by
that
when
he
comes
again
but
it
may
be
months
perhaps
before
that
happens
months
cried
marianne
with
strong
surprise
no
nor
many
weeks
mrs
dashwood
was
sorry
for
what
she
had
said
but
it
gave
elinor
pleasure
as
it
produced
a
reply
from
marianne
so
expressive
of
confidence
in
willoughby
and
knowledge
of
his
intentions
one
morning
about
a
week
after
his
leaving
the
country
marianne
was
prevailed
on
to
join
her
sisters
in
their
usual
walk
instead
of
wandering
away
by
herself
hitherto
she
had
carefully
avoided
every
companion
in
her
rambles
if
her
sisters
intended
to
walk
on
the
downs
she
directly
stole
away
towards
the
lanes
if
they
talked
of
the
valley
she
was
as
speedy
in
climbing
the
hills
and
could
never
be
found
when
the
others
set
off
but
at
length
she
was
secured
by
the
exertions
of
elinor
who
greatly
disapproved
such
continual
seclusion
they
walked
along
the
road
through
the
valley
and
chiefly
in
silence
for
marianne
s
mind
could
not
be
controlled
and
elinor
satisfied
with
gaining
one
point
would
not
then
attempt
more
beyond
the
entrance
of
the
valley
where
the
country
though
still
rich
was
less
wild
and
more
open
a
long
stretch
of
the
road
which
they
had
travelled
on
first
coming
to
barton
lay
before
them
and
on
reaching
that
point
they
stopped
to
look
around
them
and
examine
a
prospect
which
formed
the
distance
of
their
view
from
the
cottage
from
a
spot
which
they
had
never
happened
to
reach
in
any
of
their
walks
before
amongst
the
objects
in
the
scene
they
soon
discovered
an
animated
one
it
was
a
man
on
horseback
riding
towards
them
in
a
few
minutes
they
could
distinguish
him
to
be
a
gentleman
and
in
a
moment
afterwards
marianne
rapturously
exclaimed
it
is
he
it
is
indeed
i
know
it
is
and
was
hastening
to
meet
him
when
elinor
cried
out
indeed
marianne
i
think
you
are
mistaken
it
is
not
willoughby
the
person
is
not
tall
enough
for
him
and
has
not
his
air
he
has
he
has
cried
marianne
i
am
sure
he
has
his
air
his
coat
his
horse
i
knew
how
soon
he
would
come
she
walked
eagerly
on
as
she
spoke
and
elinor
to
screen
marianne
from
particularity
as
she
felt
almost
certain
of
its
not
being
willoughby
quickened
her
pace
and
kept
up
with
her
they
were
soon
within
thirty
yards
of
the
gentleman
marianne
looked
again
her
heart
sunk
within
her
and
abruptly
turning
round
she
was
hurrying
back
when
the
voices
of
both
her
sisters
were
raised
to
detain
her
a
third
almost
as
well
known
as
willoughby
s
joined
them
in
begging
her
to
stop
and
she
turned
round
with
surprise
to
see
and
welcome
edward
ferrars
he
was
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
could
at
that
moment
be
forgiven
for
not
being
willoughby
the
only
one
who
could
have
gained
a
smile
from
her
but
she
dispersed
her
tears
to
smile
on
him
and
in
her
sister
s
happiness
forgot
for
a
time
her
own
disappointment
he
dismounted
and
giving
his
horse
to
his
servant
walked
back
with
them
to
barton
whither
he
was
purposely
coming
to
visit
them
he
was
welcomed
by
them
all
with
great
cordiality
but
especially
by
marianne
who
showed
more
warmth
of
regard
in
her
reception
of
him
than
even
elinor
herself
to
marianne
indeed
the
meeting
between
edward
and
her
sister
was
but
a
continuation
of
that
unaccountable
coldness
which
she
had
often
observed
at
norland
in
their
mutual
behaviour
on
edward
s
side
more
particularly
there
was
a
deficiency
of
all
that
a
lover
ought
to
look
and
say
on
such
an
occasion
he
was
confused
seemed
scarcely
sensible
of
pleasure
in
seeing
them
looked
neither
rapturous
nor
gay
said
little
but
what
was
forced
from
him
by
questions
and
distinguished
elinor
by
no
mark
of
affection
marianne
saw
and
listened
with
increasing
surprise
she
began
almost
to
feel
a
dislike
of
edward
and
it
ended
as
every
feeling
must
end
with
her
by
carrying
back
her
thoughts
to
willoughby
whose
manners
formed
a
contrast
sufficiently
striking
to
those
of
his
brother
elect
after
a
short
silence
which
succeeded
the
first
surprise
and
enquiries
of
meeting
marianne
asked
edward
if
he
came
directly
from
london
no
he
had
been
in
devonshire
a
fortnight
a
fortnight
she
repeated
surprised
at
his
being
so
long
in
the
same
county
with
elinor
without
seeing
her
before
he
looked
rather
distressed
as
he
added
that
he
had
been
staying
with
some
friends
near
plymouth
have
you
been
lately
in
sussex
said
elinor
i
was
at
norland
about
a
month
ago
and
how
does
dear
dear
norland
look
cried
marianne
dear
dear
norland
said
elinor
probably
looks
much
as
it
always
does
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
woods
and
walks
thickly
covered
with
dead
leaves
oh
cried
marianne
with
what
transporting
sensation
have
i
formerly
seen
them
fall
how
have
i
delighted
as
i
walked
to
see
them
driven
in
showers
about
me
by
the
wind
what
feelings
have
they
the
season
the
air
altogether
inspired
now
there
is
no
one
to
regard
them
they
are
seen
only
as
a
nuisance
swept
hastily
off
and
driven
as
much
as
possible
from
the
sight
it
is
not
every
one
said
elinor
who
has
your
passion
for
dead
leaves
no
my
feelings
are
not
often
shared
not
often
understood
but
sometimes
they
are
as
she
said
this
she
sunk
into
a
reverie
for
a
few
moments
but
rousing
herself
again
now
edward
said
she
calling
his
attention
to
the
prospect
here
is
barton
valley
look
up
to
it
and
be
tranquil
if
you
can
look
at
those
hills
did
you
ever
see
their
equals
to
the
left
is
barton
park
amongst
those
woods
and
plantations
you
may
see
the
end
of
the
house
and
there
beneath
that
farthest
hill
which
rises
with
such
grandeur
is
our
cottage
it
is
a
beautiful
country
he
replied
but
these
bottoms
must
be
dirty
in
winter
how
can
you
think
of
dirt
with
such
objects
before
you
because
replied
he
smiling
among
the
rest
of
the
objects
before
me
i
see
a
very
dirty
lane
how
strange
said
marianne
to
herself
as
she
walked
on
have
you
an
agreeable
neighbourhood
here
are
the
middletons
pleasant
people
no
not
all
answered
marianne
we
could
not
be
more
unfortunately
situated
marianne
cried
her
sister
how
can
you
say
so
how
can
you
be
so
unjust
they
are
a
very
respectable
family
mr
ferrars
and
towards
us
have
behaved
in
the
friendliest
manner
have
you
forgot
marianne
how
many
pleasant
days
we
have
owed
to
them
no
said
marianne
in
a
low
voice
nor
how
many
painful
moments
elinor
took
no
notice
of
this
and
directing
her
attention
to
their
visitor
endeavoured
to
support
something
like
discourse
with
him
by
talking
of
their
present
residence
its
conveniences
c
extorting
from
him
occasional
questions
and
remarks
his
coldness
and
reserve
mortified
her
severely
she
was
vexed
and
half
angry
but
resolving
to
regulate
her
behaviour
to
him
by
the
past
rather
than
the
present
she
avoided
every
appearance
of
resentment
or
displeasure
and
treated
him
as
she
thought
he
ought
to
be
treated
from
the
family
connection
mrs
dashwood
was
surprised
only
for
a
moment
at
seeing
him
for
his
coming
to
barton
was
in
her
opinion
of
all
things
the
most
natural
her
joy
and
expression
of
regard
long
outlived
her
wonder
he
received
the
kindest
welcome
from
her
and
shyness
coldness
reserve
could
not
stand
against
such
a
reception
they
had
begun
to
fail
him
before
he
entered
the
house
and
they
were
quite
overcome
by
the
captivating
manners
of
mrs
dashwood
indeed
a
man
could
not
very
well
be
in
love
with
either
of
her
daughters
without
extending
the
passion
to
her
and
elinor
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
soon
become
more
like
himself
his
affections
seemed
to
reanimate
towards
them
all
and
his
interest
in
their
welfare
again
became
perceptible
he
was
not
in
spirits
however
he
praised
their
house
admired
its
prospect
was
attentive
and
kind
but
still
he
was
not
in
spirits
the
whole
family
perceived
it
and
mrs
dashwood
attributing
it
to
some
want
of
liberality
in
his
mother
sat
down
to
table
indignant
against
all
selfish
parents
what
are
mrs
ferrars
s
views
for
you
at
present
edward
said
she
when
dinner
was
over
and
they
had
drawn
round
the
fire
are
you
still
to
be
a
great
orator
in
spite
of
yourself
no
i
hope
my
mother
is
now
convinced
that
i
have
no
more
talents
than
inclination
for
a
public
life
but
how
is
your
fame
to
be
established
for
famous
you
must
be
to
satisfy
all
your
family
and
with
no
inclination
for
expense
no
affection
for
strangers
no
profession
and
no
assurance
you
may
find
it
a
difficult
matter
i
shall
not
attempt
it
i
have
no
wish
to
be
distinguished
and
have
every
reason
to
hope
i
never
shall
thank
heaven
i
cannot
be
forced
into
genius
and
eloquence
you
have
no
ambition
i
well
know
your
wishes
are
all
moderate
as
moderate
as
those
of
the
rest
of
the
world
i
believe
i
wish
as
well
as
every
body
else
to
be
perfectly
happy
but
like
every
body
else
it
must
be
in
my
own
way
greatness
will
not
make
me
so
strange
that
it
would
cried
marianne
what
have
wealth
or
grandeur
to
do
with
happiness
grandeur
has
but
little
said
elinor
but
wealth
has
much
to
do
with
it
elinor
for
shame
said
marianne
money
can
only
give
happiness
where
there
is
nothing
else
to
give
it
beyond
a
competence
it
can
afford
no
real
satisfaction
as
far
as
mere
self
is
concerned
perhaps
said
elinor
smiling
we
may
come
to
the
same
point
your
competence
and
my
wealth
are
very
much
alike
i
dare
say
and
without
them
as
the
world
goes
now
we
shall
both
agree
that
every
kind
of
external
comfort
must
be
wanting
your
ideas
are
only
more
noble
than
mine
come
what
is
your
competence
about
eighteen
hundred
or
two
thousand
a
year
not
more
than
that
elinor
laughed
two
thousand
a
year
one
is
my
wealth
i
guessed
how
it
would
end
and
yet
two
thousand
a
year
is
a
very
moderate
income
said
marianne
a
family
cannot
well
be
maintained
on
a
smaller
i
am
sure
i
am
not
extravagant
in
my
demands
a
proper
establishment
of
servants
a
carriage
perhaps
two
and
hunters
cannot
be
supported
on
less
elinor
smiled
again
to
hear
her
sister
describing
so
accurately
their
future
expenses
at
combe
magna
hunters
repeated
edward
but
why
must
you
have
hunters
every
body
does
not
hunt
marianne
coloured
as
she
replied
but
most
people
do
i
wish
said
margaret
striking
out
a
novel
thought
that
somebody
would
give
us
all
a
large
fortune
apiece
oh
that
they
would
cried
marianne
her
eyes
sparkling
with
animation
and
her
cheeks
glowing
with
the
delight
of
such
imaginary
happiness
we
are
all
unanimous
in
that
wish
i
suppose
said
elinor
in
spite
of
the
insufficiency
of
wealth
oh
dear
cried
margaret
how
happy
i
should
be
i
wonder
what
i
should
do
with
it
marianne
looked
as
if
she
had
no
doubt
on
that
point
i
should
be
puzzled
to
spend
so
large
a
fortune
myself
said
mrs
dashwood
if
my
children
were
all
to
be
rich
without
my
help
you
must
begin
your
improvements
on
this
house
observed
elinor
and
your
difficulties
will
soon
vanish
what
magnificent
orders
would
travel
from
this
family
to
london
said
edward
in
such
an
event
what
a
happy
day
for
booksellers
music
sellers
and
print
shops
you
miss
dashwood
would
give
a
general
commission
for
every
new
print
of
merit
to
be
sent
you
and
as
for
marianne
i
know
her
greatness
of
soul
there
would
not
be
music
enough
in
london
to
content
her
and
books
thomson
cowper
scott
she
would
buy
them
all
over
and
over
again
she
would
buy
up
every
copy
i
believe
to
prevent
their
falling
into
unworthy
hands
and
she
would
have
every
book
that
tells
her
how
to
admire
an
old
twisted
tree
should
not
you
marianne
forgive
me
if
i
am
very
saucy
but
i
was
willing
to
shew
you
that
i
had
not
forgot
our
old
disputes
i
love
to
be
reminded
of
the
past
edward
whether
it
be
melancholy
or
gay
i
love
to
recall
it
and
you
will
never
offend
me
by
talking
of
former
times
you
are
very
right
in
supposing
how
my
money
would
be
spent
some
of
it
at
least
my
loose
cash
would
certainly
be
employed
in
improving
my
collection
of
music
and
books
and
the
bulk
of
your
fortune
would
be
laid
out
in
annuities
on
the
authors
or
their
heirs
no
edward
i
should
have
something
else
to
do
with
it
perhaps
then
you
would
bestow
it
as
a
reward
on
that
person
who
wrote
the
ablest
defence
of
your
favourite
maxim
that
no
one
can
ever
be
in
love
more
than
once
in
their
life
your
opinion
on
that
point
is
unchanged
i
presume
undoubtedly
at
my
time
of
life
opinions
are
tolerably
fixed
it
is
not
likely
that
i
should
now
see
or
hear
any
thing
to
change
them
marianne
is
as
steadfast
as
ever
you
see
said
elinor
she
is
not
at
all
altered
she
is
only
grown
a
little
more
grave
than
she
was
nay
edward
said
marianne
you
need
not
reproach
me
you
are
not
very
gay
yourself
why
should
you
think
so
replied
he
with
a
sigh
but
gaiety
never
was
a
part
of
my
character
nor
do
i
think
it
a
part
of
marianne
s
said
elinor
i
should
hardly
call
her
a
lively
girl
she
is
very
earnest
very
eager
in
all
she
does
sometimes
talks
a
great
deal
and
always
with
animation
but
she
is
not
often
really
merry
i
believe
you
are
right
he
replied
and
yet
i
have
always
set
her
down
as
a
lively
girl
i
have
frequently
detected
myself
in
such
kind
of
mistakes
said
elinor
in
a
total
misapprehension
of
character
in
some
point
or
other
fancying
people
so
much
more
gay
or
grave
or
ingenious
or
stupid
than
they
really
are
and
i
can
hardly
tell
why
or
in
what
the
deception
originated
sometimes
one
is
guided
by
what
they
say
of
themselves
and
very
frequently
by
what
other
people
say
of
them
without
giving
oneself
time
to
deliberate
and
judge
but
i
thought
it
was
right
elinor
said
marianne
to
be
guided
wholly
by
the
opinion
of
other
people
i
thought
our
judgments
were
given
us
merely
to
be
subservient
to
those
of
neighbours
this
has
always
been
your
doctrine
i
am
sure
no
marianne
never
my
doctrine
has
never
aimed
at
the
subjection
of
the
understanding
all
i
have
ever
attempted
to
influence
has
been
the
behaviour
you
must
not
confound
my
meaning
i
am
guilty
i
confess
of
having
often
wished
you
to
treat
our
acquaintance
in
general
with
greater
attention
but
when
have
i
advised
you
to
adopt
their
sentiments
or
to
conform
to
their
judgment
in
serious
matters
you
have
not
been
able
to
bring
your
sister
over
to
your
plan
of
general
civility
said
edward
to
elinor
do
you
gain
no
ground
quite
the
contrary
replied
elinor
looking
expressively
at
marianne
my
judgment
he
returned
is
all
on
your
side
of
the
question
but
i
am
afraid
my
practice
is
much
more
on
your
sister
s
i
never
wish
to
offend
but
i
am
so
foolishly
shy
that
i
often
seem
negligent
when
i
am
only
kept
back
by
my
natural
awkwardness
i
have
frequently
thought
that
i
must
have
been
intended
by
nature
to
be
fond
of
low
company
i
am
so
little
at
my
ease
among
strangers
of
gentility
marianne
has
not
shyness
to
excuse
any
inattention
of
hers
said
elinor
she
knows
her
own
worth
too
well
for
false
shame
replied
edward
shyness
is
only
the
effect
of
a
sense
of
inferiority
in
some
way
or
other
if
i
could
persuade
myself
that
my
manners
were
perfectly
easy
and
graceful
i
should
not
be
shy
but
you
would
still
be
reserved
said
marianne
and
that
is
worse
edward
started
reserved
am
i
reserved
marianne
yes
very
i
do
not
understand
you
replied
he
colouring
reserved
how
in
what
manner
what
am
i
to
tell
you
what
can
you
suppose
elinor
looked
surprised
at
his
emotion
but
trying
to
laugh
off
the
subject
she
said
to
him
do
not
you
know
my
sister
well
enough
to
understand
what
she
means
do
not
you
know
she
calls
every
one
reserved
who
does
not
talk
as
fast
and
admire
what
she
admires
as
rapturously
as
herself
edward
made
no
answer
his
gravity
and
thoughtfulness
returned
on
him
in
their
fullest
extent
and
he
sat
for
some
time
silent
and
dull
elinor
saw
with
great
uneasiness
the
low
spirits
of
her
friend
his
visit
afforded
her
but
a
very
partial
satisfaction
while
his
own
enjoyment
in
it
appeared
so
imperfect
it
was
evident
that
he
was
unhappy
she
wished
it
were
equally
evident
that
he
still
distinguished
her
by
the
same
affection
which
once
she
had
felt
no
doubt
of
inspiring
but
hitherto
the
continuance
of
his
preference
seemed
very
uncertain
and
the
reservedness
of
his
manner
towards
her
contradicted
one
moment
what
a
more
animated
look
had
intimated
the
preceding
one
he
joined
her
and
marianne
in
the
breakfast
room
the
next
morning
before
the
others
were
down
and
marianne
who
was
always
eager
to
promote
their
happiness
as
far
as
she
could
soon
left
them
to
themselves
but
before
she
was
half
way
upstairs
she
heard
the
parlour
door
open
and
turning
round
was
astonished
to
see
edward
himself
come
out
i
am
going
into
the
village
to
see
my
horses
said
he
as
you
are
not
yet
ready
for
breakfast
i
shall
be
back
again
presently
edward
returned
to
them
with
fresh
admiration
of
the
surrounding
country
in
his
walk
to
the
village
he
had
seen
many
parts
of
the
valley
to
advantage
and
the
village
itself
in
a
much
higher
situation
than
the
cottage
afforded
a
general
view
of
the
whole
which
had
exceedingly
pleased
him
this
was
a
subject
which
ensured
marianne
s
attention
and
she
was
beginning
to
describe
her
own
admiration
of
these
scenes
and
to
question
him
more
minutely
on
the
objects
that
had
particularly
struck
him
when
edward
interrupted
her
by
saying
you
must
not
enquire
too
far
marianne
remember
i
have
no
knowledge
in
the
picturesque
and
i
shall
offend
you
by
my
ignorance
and
want
of
taste
if
we
come
to
particulars
i
shall
call
hills
steep
which
ought
to
be
bold
surfaces
strange
and
uncouth
which
ought
to
be
irregular
and
rugged
and
distant
objects
out
of
sight
which
ought
only
to
be
indistinct
through
the
soft
medium
of
a
hazy
atmosphere
you
must
be
satisfied
with
such
admiration
as
i
can
honestly
give
i
call
it
a
very
fine
country
the
hills
are
steep
the
woods
seem
full
of
fine
timber
and
the
valley
looks
comfortable
and
snug
with
rich
meadows
and
several
neat
farm
houses
scattered
here
and
there
it
exactly
answers
my
idea
of
a
fine
country
because
it
unites
beauty
with
utility
and
i
dare
say
it
is
a
picturesque
one
too
because
you
admire
it
i
can
easily
believe
it
to
be
full
of
rocks
and
promontories
grey
moss
and
brush
wood
but
these
are
all
lost
on
me
i
know
nothing
of
the
picturesque
i
am
afraid
it
is
but
too
true
said
marianne
but
why
should
you
boast
of
it
i
suspect
said
elinor
that
to
avoid
one
kind
of
affectation
edward
here
falls
into
another
because
he
believes
many
people
pretend
to
more
admiration
of
the
beauties
of
nature
than
they
really
feel
and
is
disgusted
with
such
pretensions
he
affects
greater
indifference
and
less
discrimination
in
viewing
them
himself
than
he
possesses
he
is
fastidious
and
will
have
an
affectation
of
his
own
it
is
very
true
said
marianne
that
admiration
of
landscape
scenery
is
become
a
mere
jargon
every
body
pretends
to
feel
and
tries
to
describe
with
the
taste
and
elegance
of
him
who
first
defined
what
picturesque
beauty
was
i
detest
jargon
of
every
kind
and
sometimes
i
have
kept
my
feelings
to
myself
because
i
could
find
no
language
to
describe
them
in
but
what
was
worn
and
hackneyed
out
of
all
sense
and
meaning
i
am
convinced
said
edward
that
you
really
feel
all
the
delight
in
a
fine
prospect
which
you
profess
to
feel
but
in
return
your
sister
must
allow
me
to
feel
no
more
than
i
profess
i
like
a
fine
prospect
but
not
on
picturesque
principles
i
do
not
like
crooked
twisted
blasted
trees
i
admire
them
much
more
if
they
are
tall
straight
and
flourishing
i
do
not
like
ruined
tattered
cottages
i
am
not
fond
of
nettles
or
thistles
or
heath
blossoms
i
have
more
pleasure
in
a
snug
farm
house
than
a
watch
tower
and
a
troop
of
tidy
happy
villages
please
me
better
than
the
finest
banditti
in
the
world
marianne
looked
with
amazement
at
edward
with
compassion
at
her
sister
elinor
only
laughed
the
subject
was
continued
no
farther
and
marianne
remained
thoughtfully
silent
till
a
new
object
suddenly
engaged
her
attention
she
was
sitting
by
edward
and
in
taking
his
tea
from
mrs
dashwood
his
hand
passed
so
directly
before
her
as
to
make
a
ring
with
a
plait
of
hair
in
the
centre
very
conspicuous
on
one
of
his
fingers
i
never
saw
you
wear
a
ring
before
edward
she
cried
is
that
fanny
s
hair
i
remember
her
promising
to
give
you
some
but
i
should
have
thought
her
hair
had
been
darker
marianne
spoke
inconsiderately
what
she
really
felt
but
when
she
saw
how
much
she
had
pained
edward
her
own
vexation
at
her
want
of
thought
could
not
be
surpassed
by
his
he
coloured
very
deeply
and
giving
a
momentary
glance
at
elinor
replied
yes
it
is
my
sister
s
hair
the
setting
always
casts
a
different
shade
on
it
you
know
elinor
had
met
his
eye
and
looked
conscious
likewise
that
the
hair
was
her
own
she
instantaneously
felt
as
well
satisfied
as
marianne
the
only
difference
in
their
conclusions
was
that
what
marianne
considered
as
a
free
gift
from
her
sister
elinor
was
conscious
must
have
been
procured
by
some
theft
or
contrivance
unknown
to
herself
she
was
not
in
a
humour
however
to
regard
it
as
an
affront
and
affecting
to
take
no
notice
of
what
passed
by
instantly
talking
of
something
else
she
internally
resolved
henceforward
to
catch
every
opportunity
of
eyeing
the
hair
and
of
satisfying
herself
beyond
all
doubt
that
it
was
exactly
the
shade
of
her
own
edward
s
embarrassment
lasted
some
time
and
it
ended
in
an
absence
of
mind
still
more
settled
he
was
particularly
grave
the
whole
morning
marianne
severely
censured
herself
for
what
she
had
said
but
her
own
forgiveness
might
have
been
more
speedy
had
she
known
how
little
offence
it
had
given
her
sister
before
the
middle
of
the
day
they
were
visited
by
sir
john
and
mrs
jennings
who
having
heard
of
the
arrival
of
a
gentleman
at
the
cottage
came
to
take
a
survey
of
the
guest
with
the
assistance
of
his
mother
in
law
sir
john
was
not
long
in
discovering
that
the
name
of
ferrars
began
with
an
f
and
this
prepared
a
future
mine
of
raillery
against
the
devoted
elinor
which
nothing
but
the
newness
of
their
acquaintance
with
edward
could
have
prevented
from
being
immediately
sprung
but
as
it
was
she
only
learned
from
some
very
significant
looks
how
far
their
penetration
founded
on
margaret
s
instructions
extended
sir
john
never
came
to
the
dashwoods
without
either
inviting
them
to
dine
at
the
park
the
next
day
or
to
drink
tea
with
them
that
evening
on
the
present
occasion
for
the
better
entertainment
of
their
visitor
towards
whose
amusement
he
felt
himself
bound
to
contribute
he
wished
to
engage
them
for
both
you
must
drink
tea
with
us
to
night
said
he
for
we
shall
be
quite
alone
and
tomorrow
you
must
absolutely
dine
with
us
for
we
shall
be
a
large
party
mrs
jennings
enforced
the
necessity
and
who
knows
but
you
may
raise
a
dance
said
she
and
that
will
tempt
you
miss
marianne
a
dance
cried
marianne
impossible
who
is
to
dance
who
why
yourselves
and
the
careys
and
whitakers
to
be
sure
what
you
thought
nobody
could
dance
because
a
certain
person
that
shall
be
nameless
is
gone
i
wish
with
all
my
soul
cried
sir
john
that
willoughby
were
among
us
again
this
and
marianne
s
blushing
gave
new
suspicions
to
edward
and
who
is
willoughby
said
he
in
a
low
voice
to
miss
dashwood
by
whom
he
was
sitting
she
gave
him
a
brief
reply
marianne
s
countenance
was
more
communicative
edward
saw
enough
to
comprehend
not
only
the
meaning
of
others
but
such
of
marianne
s
expressions
as
had
puzzled
him
before
and
when
their
visitors
left
them
he
went
immediately
round
her
and
said
in
a
whisper
i
have
been
guessing
shall
i
tell
you
my
guess
what
do
you
mean
shall
i
tell
you
certainly
well
then
i
guess
that
mr
willoughby
hunts
marianne
was
surprised
and
confused
yet
she
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
quiet
archness
of
his
manner
and
after
a
moment
s
silence
said
oh
edward
how
can
you
but
the
time
will
come
i
hope
i
am
sure
you
will
like
him
i
do
not
doubt
it
replied
he
rather
astonished
at
her
earnestness
and
warmth
for
had
he
not
imagined
it
to
be
a
joke
for
the
good
of
her
acquaintance
in
general
founded
only
on
a
something
or
a
nothing
between
mr
willoughby
and
herself
he
would
not
have
ventured
to
mention
it
edward
remained
a
week
at
the
cottage
he
was
earnestly
pressed
by
mrs
dashwood
to
stay
longer
but
as
if
he
were
bent
only
on
self
mortification
he
seemed
resolved
to
be
gone
when
his
enjoyment
among
his
friends
was
at
the
height
his
spirits
during
the
last
two
or
three
days
though
still
very
unequal
were
greatly
improved
he
grew
more
and
more
partial
to
the
house
and
environs
never
spoke
of
going
away
without
a
sigh
declared
his
time
to
be
wholly
disengaged
even
doubted
to
what
place
he
should
go
when
he
left
them
but
still
go
he
must
never
had
any
week
passed
so
quickly
he
could
hardly
believe
it
to
be
gone
he
said
so
repeatedly
other
things
he
said
too
which
marked
the
turn
of
his
feelings
and
gave
the
lie
to
his
actions
he
had
no
pleasure
at
norland
he
detested
being
in
town
but
either
to
norland
or
london
he
must
go
he
valued
their
kindness
beyond
any
thing
and
his
greatest
happiness
was
in
being
with
them
yet
he
must
leave
them
at
the
end
of
a
week
in
spite
of
their
wishes
and
his
own
and
without
any
restraint
on
his
time
elinor
placed
all
that
was
astonishing
in
this
way
of
acting
to
his
mother
s
account
and
it
was
happy
for
her
that
he
had
a
mother
whose
character
was
so
imperfectly
known
to
her
as
to
be
the
general
excuse
for
every
thing
strange
on
the
part
of
her
son
disappointed
however
and
vexed
as
she
was
and
sometimes
displeased
with
his
uncertain
behaviour
to
herself
she
was
very
well
disposed
on
the
whole
to
regard
his
actions
with
all
the
candid
allowances
and
generous
qualifications
which
had
been
rather
more
painfully
extorted
from
her
for
willoughby
s
service
by
her
mother
his
want
of
spirits
of
openness
and
of
consistency
were
most
usually
attributed
to
his
want
of
independence
and
his
better
knowledge
of
mrs
ferrars
s
disposition
and
designs
the
shortness
of
his
visit
the
steadiness
of
his
purpose
in
leaving
them
originated
in
the
same
fettered
inclination
the
same
inevitable
necessity
of
temporizing
with
his
mother
the
old
well
established
grievance
of
duty
against
will
parent
against
child
was
the
cause
of
all
she
would
have
been
glad
to
know
when
these
difficulties
were
to
cease
this
opposition
was
to
yield
when
mrs
ferrars
would
be
reformed
and
her
son
be
at
liberty
to
be
happy
but
from
such
vain
wishes
she
was
forced
to
turn
for
comfort
to
the
renewal
of
her
confidence
in
edward
s
affection
to
the
remembrance
of
every
mark
of
regard
in
look
or
word
which
fell
from
him
while
at
barton
and
above
all
to
that
flattering
proof
of
it
which
he
constantly
wore
round
his
finger
i
think
edward
said
mrs
dashwood
as
they
were
at
breakfast
the
last
morning
you
would
be
a
happier
man
if
you
had
any
profession
to
engage
your
time
and
give
an
interest
to
your
plans
and
actions
some
inconvenience
to
your
friends
indeed
might
result
from
it
you
would
not
be
able
to
give
them
so
much
of
your
time
but
with
a
smile
you
would
be
materially
benefited
in
one
particular
at
least
you
would
know
where
to
go
when
you
left
them
i
do
assure
you
he
replied
that
i
have
long
thought
on
this
point
as
you
think
now
it
has
been
and
is
and
probably
will
always
be
a
heavy
misfortune
to
me
that
i
have
had
no
necessary
business
to
engage
me
no
profession
to
give
me
employment
or
afford
me
any
thing
like
independence
but
unfortunately
my
own
nicety
and
the
nicety
of
my
friends
have
made
me
what
i
am
an
idle
helpless
being
we
never
could
agree
in
our
choice
of
a
profession
i
always
preferred
the
church
as
i
still
do
but
that
was
not
smart
enough
for
my
family
they
recommended
the
army
that
was
a
great
deal
too
smart
for
me
the
law
was
allowed
to
be
genteel
enough
many
young
men
who
had
chambers
in
the
temple
made
a
very
good
appearance
in
the
first
circles
and
drove
about
town
in
very
knowing
gigs
but
i
had
no
inclination
for
the
law
even
in
this
less
abstruse
study
of
it
which
my
family
approved
as
for
the
navy
it
had
fashion
on
its
side
but
i
was
too
old
when
the
subject
was
first
started
to
enter
it
and
at
length
as
there
was
no
necessity
for
my
having
any
profession
at
all
as
i
might
be
as
dashing
and
expensive
without
a
red
coat
on
my
back
as
with
one
idleness
was
pronounced
on
the
whole
to
be
most
advantageous
and
honourable
and
a
young
man
of
eighteen
is
not
in
general
so
earnestly
bent
on
being
busy
as
to
resist
the
solicitations
of
his
friends
to
do
nothing
i
was
therefore
entered
at
oxford
and
have
been
properly
idle
ever
since
the
consequence
of
which
i
suppose
will
be
said
mrs
dashwood
since
leisure
has
not
promoted
your
own
happiness
that
your
sons
will
be
brought
up
to
as
many
pursuits
employments
professions
and
trades
as
columella
s
they
will
be
brought
up
said
he
in
a
serious
accent
to
be
as
unlike
myself
as
is
possible
in
feeling
in
action
in
condition
in
every
thing
come
come
this
is
all
an
effusion
of
immediate
want
of
spirits
edward
you
are
in
a
melancholy
humour
and
fancy
that
any
one
unlike
yourself
must
be
happy
but
remember
that
the
pain
of
parting
from
friends
will
be
felt
by
every
body
at
times
whatever
be
their
education
or
state
know
your
own
happiness
you
want
nothing
but
patience
or
give
it
a
more
fascinating
name
call
it
hope
your
mother
will
secure
to
you
in
time
that
independence
you
are
so
anxious
for
it
is
her
duty
and
it
will
it
must
ere
long
become
her
happiness
to
prevent
your
whole
youth
from
being
wasted
in
discontent
how
much
may
not
a
few
months
do
i
think
replied
edward
that
i
may
defy
many
months
to
produce
any
good
to
me
this
desponding
turn
of
mind
though
it
could
not
be
communicated
to
mrs
dashwood
gave
additional
pain
to
them
all
in
the
parting
which
shortly
took
place
and
left
an
uncomfortable
impression
on
elinor
s
feelings
especially
which
required
some
trouble
and
time
to
subdue
but
as
it
was
her
determination
to
subdue
it
and
to
prevent
herself
from
appearing
to
suffer
more
than
what
all
her
family
suffered
on
his
going
away
she
did
not
adopt
the
method
so
judiciously
employed
by
marianne
on
a
similar
occasion
to
augment
and
fix
her
sorrow
by
seeking
silence
solitude
and
idleness
their
means
were
as
different
as
their
objects
and
equally
suited
to
the
advancement
of
each
elinor
sat
down
to
her
drawing
table
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
house
busily
employed
herself
the
whole
day
neither
sought
nor
avoided
the
mention
of
his
name
appeared
to
interest
herself
almost
as
much
as
ever
in
the
general
concerns
of
the
family
and
if
by
this
conduct
she
did
not
lessen
her
own
grief
it
was
at
least
prevented
from
unnecessary
increase
and
her
mother
and
sisters
were
spared
much
solicitude
on
her
account
such
behaviour
as
this
so
exactly
the
reverse
of
her
own
appeared
no
more
meritorious
to
marianne
than
her
own
had
seemed
faulty
to
her
the
business
of
self
command
she
settled
very
easily
with
strong
affections
it
was
impossible
with
calm
ones
it
could
have
no
merit
that
her
sister
s
affections
were
calm
she
dared
not
deny
though
she
blushed
to
acknowledge
it
and
of
the
strength
of
her
own
she
gave
a
very
striking
proof
by
still
loving
and
respecting
that
sister
in
spite
of
this
mortifying
conviction
without
shutting
herself
up
from
her
family
or
leaving
the
house
in
determined
solitude
to
avoid
them
or
lying
awake
the
whole
night
to
indulge
meditation
elinor
found
every
day
afforded
her
leisure
enough
to
think
of
edward
and
of
edward
s
behaviour
in
every
possible
variety
which
the
different
state
of
her
spirits
at
different
times
could
produce
with
tenderness
pity
approbation
censure
and
doubt
there
were
moments
in
abundance
when
if
not
by
the
absence
of
her
mother
and
sisters
at
least
by
the
nature
of
their
employments
conversation
was
forbidden
among
them
and
every
effect
of
solitude
was
produced
her
mind
was
inevitably
at
liberty
her
thoughts
could
not
be
chained
elsewhere
and
the
past
and
the
future
on
a
subject
so
interesting
must
be
before
her
must
force
her
attention
and
engross
her
memory
her
reflection
and
her
fancy
from
a
reverie
of
this
kind
as
she
sat
at
her
drawing
table
she
was
roused
one
morning
soon
after
edward
s
leaving
them
by
the
arrival
of
company
she
happened
to
be
quite
alone
the
closing
of
the
little
gate
at
the
entrance
of
the
green
court
in
front
of
the
house
drew
her
eyes
to
the
window
and
she
saw
a
large
party
walking
up
to
the
door
amongst
them
were
sir
john
and
lady
middleton
and
mrs
jennings
but
there
were
two
others
a
gentleman
and
lady
who
were
quite
unknown
to
her
she
was
sitting
near
the
window
and
as
soon
as
sir
john
perceived
her
he
left
the
rest
of
the
party
to
the
ceremony
of
knocking
at
the
door
and
stepping
across
the
turf
obliged
her
to
open
the
casement
to
speak
to
him
though
the
space
was
so
short
between
the
door
and
the
window
as
to
make
it
hardly
possible
to
speak
at
one
without
being
heard
at
the
other
well
said
he
we
have
brought
you
some
strangers
how
do
you
like
them
hush
they
will
hear
you
never
mind
if
they
do
it
is
only
the
palmers
charlotte
is
very
pretty
i
can
tell
you
you
may
see
her
if
you
look
this
way
as
elinor
was
certain
of
seeing
her
in
a
couple
of
minutes
without
taking
that
liberty
she
begged
to
be
excused
where
is
marianne
has
she
run
away
because
we
are
come
i
see
her
instrument
is
open
she
is
walking
i
believe
they
were
now
joined
by
mrs
jennings
who
had
not
patience
enough
to
wait
till
the
door
was
opened
before
she
told
her
story
she
came
hallooing
to
the
window
how
do
you
do
my
dear
how
does
mrs
dashwood
do
and
where
are
your
sisters
what
all
alone
you
will
be
glad
of
a
little
company
to
sit
with
you
i
have
brought
my
other
son
and
daughter
to
see
you
only
think
of
their
coming
so
suddenly
i
thought
i
heard
a
carriage
last
night
while
we
were
drinking
our
tea
but
it
never
entered
my
head
that
it
could
be
them
i
thought
of
nothing
but
whether
it
might
not
be
colonel
brandon
come
back
again
so
i
said
to
sir
john
i
do
think
i
hear
a
carriage
perhaps
it
is
colonel
brandon
come
back
again
elinor
was
obliged
to
turn
from
her
in
the
middle
of
her
story
to
receive
the
rest
of
the
party
lady
middleton
introduced
the
two
strangers
mrs
dashwood
and
margaret
came
down
stairs
at
the
same
time
and
they
all
sat
down
to
look
at
one
another
while
mrs
jennings
continued
her
story
as
she
walked
through
the
passage
into
the
parlour
attended
by
sir
john
mrs
palmer
was
several
years
younger
than
lady
middleton
and
totally
unlike
her
in
every
respect
she
was
short
and
plump
had
a
very
pretty
face
and
the
finest
expression
of
good
humour
in
it
that
could
possibly
be
her
manners
were
by
no
means
so
elegant
as
her
sister
s
but
they
were
much
more
prepossessing
she
came
in
with
a
smile
smiled
all
the
time
of
her
visit
except
when
she
laughed
and
smiled
when
she
went
away
her
husband
was
a
grave
looking
young
man
of
five
or
six
and
twenty
with
an
air
of
more
fashion
and
sense
than
his
wife
but
of
less
willingness
to
please
or
be
pleased
he
entered
the
room
with
a
look
of
self
consequence
slightly
bowed
to
the
ladies
without
speaking
a
word
and
after
briefly
surveying
them
and
their
apartments
took
up
a
newspaper
from
the
table
and
continued
to
read
it
as
long
as
he
staid
mrs
palmer
on
the
contrary
who
was
strongly
endowed
by
nature
with
a
turn
for
being
uniformly
civil
and
happy
was
hardly
seated
before
her
admiration
of
the
parlour
and
every
thing
in
it
burst
forth
well
what
a
delightful
room
this
is
i
never
saw
anything
so
charming
only
think
mama
how
it
is
improved
since
i
was
here
last
i
always
thought
it
such
a
sweet
place
ma
am
turning
to
mrs
dashwood
but
you
have
made
it
so
charming
only
look
sister
how
delightful
every
thing
is
how
i
should
like
such
a
house
for
myself
should
not
you
mr
palmer
mr
palmer
made
her
no
answer
and
did
not
even
raise
his
eyes
from
the
newspaper
mr
palmer
does
not
hear
me
said
she
laughing
he
never
does
sometimes
it
is
so
ridiculous
this
was
quite
a
new
idea
to
mrs
dashwood
she
had
never
been
used
to
find
wit
in
the
inattention
of
any
one
and
could
not
help
looking
with
surprise
at
them
both
mrs
jennings
in
the
meantime
talked
on
as
loud
as
she
could
and
continued
her
account
of
their
surprise
the
evening
before
on
seeing
their
friends
without
ceasing
till
every
thing
was
told
mrs
palmer
laughed
heartily
at
the
recollection
of
their
astonishment
and
every
body
agreed
two
or
three
times
over
that
it
had
been
quite
an
agreeable
surprise
you
may
believe
how
glad
we
all
were
to
see
them
added
mrs
jennings
leaning
forward
towards
elinor
and
speaking
in
a
low
voice
as
if
she
meant
to
be
heard
by
no
one
else
though
they
were
seated
on
different
sides
of
the
room
but
however
i
can
t
help
wishing
they
had
not
travelled
quite
so
fast
nor
made
such
a
long
journey
of
it
for
they
came
all
round
by
london
upon
account
of
some
business
for
you
know
nodding
significantly
and
pointing
to
her
daughter
it
was
wrong
in
her
situation
i
wanted
her
to
stay
at
home
and
rest
this
morning
but
she
would
come
with
us
she
longed
so
much
to
see
you
all
mrs
palmer
laughed
and
said
it
would
not
do
her
any
harm
she
expects
to
be
confined
in
february
continued
mrs
jennings
lady
middleton
could
no
longer
endure
such
a
conversation
and
therefore
exerted
herself
to
ask
mr
palmer
if
there
was
any
news
in
the
paper
no
none
at
all
he
replied
and
read
on
here
comes
marianne
cried
sir
john
now
palmer
you
shall
see
a
monstrous
pretty
girl
he
immediately
went
into
the
passage
opened
the
front
door
and
ushered
her
in
himself
mrs
jennings
asked
her
as
soon
as
she
appeared
if
she
had
not
been
to
allenham
and
mrs
palmer
laughed
so
heartily
at
the
question
as
to
show
she
understood
it
mr
palmer
looked
up
on
her
entering
the
room
stared
at
her
some
minutes
and
then
returned
to
his
newspaper
mrs
palmer
s
eye
was
now
caught
by
the
drawings
which
hung
round
the
room
she
got
up
to
examine
them
oh
dear
how
beautiful
these
are
well
how
delightful
do
but
look
mama
how
sweet
i
declare
they
are
quite
charming
i
could
look
at
them
for
ever
and
then
sitting
down
again
she
very
soon
forgot
that
there
were
any
such
things
in
the
room
when
lady
middleton
rose
to
go
away
mr
palmer
rose
also
laid
down
the
newspaper
stretched
himself
and
looked
at
them
all
around
my
love
have
you
been
asleep
said
his
wife
laughing
he
made
her
no
answer
and
only
observed
after
again
examining
the
room
that
it
was
very
low
pitched
and
that
the
ceiling
was
crooked
he
then
made
his
bow
and
departed
with
the
rest
sir
john
had
been
very
urgent
with
them
all
to
spend
the
next
day
at
the
park
mrs
dashwood
who
did
not
chuse
to
dine
with
them
oftener
than
they
dined
at
the
cottage
absolutely
refused
on
her
own
account
her
daughters
might
do
as
they
pleased
but
they
had
no
curiosity
to
see
how
mr
and
mrs
palmer
ate
their
dinner
and
no
expectation
of
pleasure
from
them
in
any
other
way
they
attempted
therefore
likewise
to
excuse
themselves
the
weather
was
uncertain
and
not
likely
to
be
good
but
sir
john
would
not
be
satisfied
the
carriage
should
be
sent
for
them
and
they
must
come
lady
middleton
too
though
she
did
not
press
their
mother
pressed
them
mrs
jennings
and
mrs
palmer
joined
their
entreaties
all
seemed
equally
anxious
to
avoid
a
family
party
and
the
young
ladies
were
obliged
to
yield
why
should
they
ask
us
said
marianne
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
the
rent
of
this
cottage
is
said
to
be
low
but
we
have
it
on
very
hard
terms
if
we
are
to
dine
at
the
park
whenever
any
one
is
staying
either
with
them
or
with
us
they
mean
no
less
to
be
civil
and
kind
to
us
now
said
elinor
by
these
frequent
invitations
than
by
those
which
we
received
from
them
a
few
weeks
ago
the
alteration
is
not
in
them
if
their
parties
are
grown
tedious
and
dull
we
must
look
for
the
change
elsewhere
as
the
miss
dashwoods
entered
the
drawing
room
of
the
park
the
next
day
at
one
door
mrs
palmer
came
running
in
at
the
other
looking
as
good
humoured
and
merry
as
before
she
took
them
all
most
affectionately
by
the
hand
and
expressed
great
delight
in
seeing
them
again
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
said
she
seating
herself
between
elinor
and
marianne
for
it
is
so
bad
a
day
i
was
afraid
you
might
not
come
which
would
be
a
shocking
thing
as
we
go
away
again
tomorrow
we
must
go
for
the
westons
come
to
us
next
week
you
know
it
was
quite
a
sudden
thing
our
coming
at
all
and
i
knew
nothing
of
it
till
the
carriage
was
coming
to
the
door
and
then
mr
palmer
asked
me
if
i
would
go
with
him
to
barton
he
is
so
droll
he
never
tells
me
any
thing
i
am
so
sorry
we
cannot
stay
longer
however
we
shall
meet
again
in
town
very
soon
i
hope
they
were
obliged
to
put
an
end
to
such
an
expectation
not
go
to
town
cried
mrs
palmer
with
a
laugh
i
shall
be
quite
disappointed
if
you
do
not
i
could
get
the
nicest
house
in
the
world
for
you
next
door
to
ours
in
hanover
square
you
must
come
indeed
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
chaperon
you
at
any
time
till
i
am
confined
if
mrs
dashwood
should
not
like
to
go
into
public
they
thanked
her
but
were
obliged
to
resist
all
her
entreaties
oh
my
love
cried
mrs
palmer
to
her
husband
who
just
then
entered
the
room
you
must
help
me
to
persuade
the
miss
dashwoods
to
go
to
town
this
winter
her
love
made
no
answer
and
after
slightly
bowing
to
the
ladies
began
complaining
of
the
weather
how
horrid
all
this
is
said
he
such
weather
makes
every
thing
and
every
body
disgusting
dullness
is
as
much
produced
within
doors
as
without
by
rain
it
makes
one
detest
all
one
s
acquaintance
what
the
devil
does
sir
john
mean
by
not
having
a
billiard
room
in
his
house
how
few
people
know
what
comfort
is
sir
john
is
as
stupid
as
the
weather
the
rest
of
the
company
soon
dropt
in
i
am
afraid
miss
marianne
said
sir
john
you
have
not
been
able
to
take
your
usual
walk
to
allenham
today
marianne
looked
very
grave
and
said
nothing
oh
don
t
be
so
sly
before
us
said
mrs
palmer
for
we
know
all
about
it
i
assure
you
and
i
admire
your
taste
very
much
for
i
think
he
is
extremely
handsome
we
do
not
live
a
great
way
from
him
in
the
country
you
know
not
above
ten
miles
i
dare
say
much
nearer
thirty
said
her
husband
ah
well
there
is
not
much
difference
i
never
was
at
his
house
but
they
say
it
is
a
sweet
pretty
place
as
vile
a
spot
as
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
said
mr
palmer
marianne
remained
perfectly
silent
though
her
countenance
betrayed
her
interest
in
what
was
said
is
it
very
ugly
continued
mrs
palmer
then
it
must
be
some
other
place
that
is
so
pretty
i
suppose
when
they
were
seated
in
the
dining
room
sir
john
observed
with
regret
that
they
were
only
eight
all
together
my
dear
said
he
to
his
lady
it
is
very
provoking
that
we
should
be
so
few
why
did
not
you
ask
the
gilberts
to
come
to
us
today
did
not
i
tell
you
sir
john
when
you
spoke
to
me
about
it
before
that
it
could
not
be
done
they
dined
with
us
last
you
and
i
sir
john
said
mrs
jennings
should
not
stand
upon
such
ceremony
then
you
would
be
very
ill
bred
cried
mr
palmer
my
love
you
contradict
every
body
said
his
wife
with
her
usual
laugh
do
you
know
that
you
are
quite
rude
i
did
not
know
i
contradicted
any
body
in
calling
your
mother
ill
bred
ay
you
may
abuse
me
as
you
please
said
the
good
natured
old
lady
you
have
taken
charlotte
off
my
hands
and
cannot
give
her
back
again
so
there
i
have
the
whip
hand
of
you
charlotte
laughed
heartily
to
think
that
her
husband
could
not
get
rid
of
her
and
exultingly
said
she
did
not
care
how
cross
he
was
to
her
as
they
must
live
together
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
be
more
thoroughly
good
natured
or
more
determined
to
be
happy
than
mrs
palmer
the
studied
indifference
insolence
and
discontent
of
her
husband
gave
her
no
pain
and
when
he
scolded
or
abused
her
she
was
highly
diverted
mr
palmer
is
so
droll
said
she
in
a
whisper
to
elinor
he
is
always
out
of
humour
elinor
was
not
inclined
after
a
little
observation
to
give
him
credit
for
being
so
genuinely
and
unaffectedly
ill
natured
or
ill
bred
as
he
wished
to
appear
his
temper
might
perhaps
be
a
little
soured
by
finding
like
many
others
of
his
sex
that
through
some
unaccountable
bias
in
favour
of
beauty
he
was
the
husband
of
a
very
silly
woman
but
she
knew
that
this
kind
of
blunder
was
too
common
for
any
sensible
man
to
be
lastingly
hurt
by
it
it
was
rather
a
wish
of
distinction
she
believed
which
produced
his
contemptuous
treatment
of
every
body
and
his
general
abuse
of
every
thing
before
him
it
was
the
desire
of
appearing
superior
to
other
people
the
motive
was
too
common
to
be
wondered
at
but
the
means
however
they
might
succeed
by
establishing
his
superiority
in
ill
breeding
were
not
likely
to
attach
any
one
to
him
except
his
wife
oh
my
dear
miss
dashwood
said
mrs
palmer
soon
afterwards
i
have
got
such
a
favour
to
ask
of
you
and
your
sister
will
you
come
and
spend
some
time
at
cleveland
this
christmas
now
pray
do
and
come
while
the
westons
are
with
us
you
cannot
think
how
happy
i
shall
be
it
will
be
quite
delightful
my
love
applying
to
her
husband
don
t
you
long
to
have
the
miss
dashwoods
come
to
cleveland
certainly
he
replied
with
a
sneer
i
came
into
devonshire
with
no
other
view
there
now
said
his
lady
you
see
mr
palmer
expects
you
so
you
cannot
refuse
to
come
they
both
eagerly
and
resolutely
declined
her
invitation
but
indeed
you
must
and
shall
come
i
am
sure
you
will
like
it
of
all
things
the
westons
will
be
with
us
and
it
will
be
quite
delightful
you
cannot
think
what
a
sweet
place
cleveland
is
and
we
are
so
gay
now
for
mr
palmer
is
always
going
about
the
country
canvassing
against
the
election
and
so
many
people
came
to
dine
with
us
that
i
never
saw
before
it
is
quite
charming
but
poor
fellow
it
is
very
fatiguing
to
him
for
he
is
forced
to
make
every
body
like
him
elinor
could
hardly
keep
her
countenance
as
she
assented
to
the
hardship
of
such
an
obligation
how
charming
it
will
be
said
charlotte
when
he
is
in
parliament
won
t
it
how
i
shall
laugh
it
will
be
so
ridiculous
to
see
all
his
letters
directed
to
him
with
an
m
p
but
do
you
know
he
says
he
will
never
frank
for
me
he
declares
he
won
t
don
t
you
mr
palmer
mr
palmer
took
no
notice
of
her
he
cannot
bear
writing
you
know
she
continued
he
says
it
is
quite
shocking
no
said
he
i
never
said
any
thing
so
irrational
don
t
palm
all
your
abuses
of
languages
upon
me
there
now
you
see
how
droll
he
is
this
is
always
the
way
with
him
sometimes
he
won
t
speak
to
me
for
half
a
day
together
and
then
he
comes
out
with
something
so
droll
all
about
any
thing
in
the
world
she
surprised
elinor
very
much
as
they
returned
into
the
drawing
room
by
asking
her
whether
she
did
not
like
mr
palmer
excessively
certainly
said
elinor
he
seems
very
agreeable
well
i
am
so
glad
you
do
i
thought
you
would
he
is
so
pleasant
and
mr
palmer
is
excessively
pleased
with
you
and
your
sisters
i
can
tell
you
and
you
can
t
think
how
disappointed
he
will
be
if
you
don
t
come
to
cleveland
i
can
t
imagine
why
you
should
object
to
it
elinor
was
again
obliged
to
decline
her
invitation
and
by
changing
the
subject
put
a
stop
to
her
entreaties
she
thought
it
probable
that
as
they
lived
in
the
same
county
mrs
palmer
might
be
able
to
give
some
more
particular
account
of
willoughby
s
general
character
than
could
be
gathered
from
the
middletons
partial
acquaintance
with
him
and
she
was
eager
to
gain
from
any
one
such
a
confirmation
of
his
merits
as
might
remove
the
possibility
of
fear
from
marianne
she
began
by
inquiring
if
they
saw
much
of
mr
willoughby
at
cleveland
and
whether
they
were
intimately
acquainted
with
him
oh
dear
yes
i
know
him
extremely
well
replied
mrs
palmer
not
that
i
ever
spoke
to
him
indeed
but
i
have
seen
him
for
ever
in
town
somehow
or
other
i
never
happened
to
be
staying
at
barton
while
he
was
at
allenham
mama
saw
him
here
once
before
but
i
was
with
my
uncle
at
weymouth
however
i
dare
say
we
should
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
him
in
somersetshire
if
it
had
not
happened
very
unluckily
that
we
should
never
have
been
in
the
country
together
he
is
very
little
at
combe
i
believe
but
if
he
were
ever
so
much
there
i
do
not
think
mr
palmer
would
visit
him
for
he
is
in
the
opposition
you
know
and
besides
it
is
such
a
way
off
i
know
why
you
inquire
about
him
very
well
your
sister
is
to
marry
him
i
am
monstrous
glad
of
it
for
then
i
shall
have
her
for
a
neighbour
you
know
upon
my
word
replied
elinor
you
know
much
more
of
the
matter
than
i
do
if
you
have
any
reason
to
expect
such
a
match
don
t
pretend
to
deny
it
because
you
know
it
is
what
every
body
talks
of
i
assure
you
i
heard
of
it
in
my
way
through
town
my
dear
mrs
palmer
upon
my
honour
i
did
i
met
colonel
brandon
monday
morning
in
bond
street
just
before
we
left
town
and
he
told
me
of
it
directly
you
surprise
me
very
much
colonel
brandon
tell
you
of
it
surely
you
must
be
mistaken
to
give
such
intelligence
to
a
person
who
could
not
be
interested
in
it
even
if
it
were
true
is
not
what
i
should
expect
colonel
brandon
to
do
but
i
do
assure
you
it
was
so
for
all
that
and
i
will
tell
you
how
it
happened
when
we
met
him
he
turned
back
and
walked
with
us
and
so
we
began
talking
of
my
brother
and
sister
and
one
thing
and
another
and
i
said
to
him
so
colonel
there
is
a
new
family
come
to
barton
cottage
i
hear
and
mama
sends
me
word
they
are
very
pretty
and
that
one
of
them
is
going
to
be
married
to
mr
willoughby
of
combe
magna
is
it
true
pray
for
of
course
you
must
know
as
you
have
been
in
devonshire
so
lately
and
what
did
the
colonel
say
oh
he
did
not
say
much
but
he
looked
as
if
he
knew
it
to
be
true
so
from
that
moment
i
set
it
down
as
certain
it
will
be
quite
delightful
i
declare
when
is
it
to
take
place
mr
brandon
was
very
well
i
hope
oh
yes
quite
well
and
so
full
of
your
praises
he
did
nothing
but
say
fine
things
of
you
i
am
flattered
by
his
commendation
he
seems
an
excellent
man
and
i
think
him
uncommonly
pleasing
so
do
i
he
is
such
a
charming
man
that
it
is
quite
a
pity
he
should
be
so
grave
and
so
dull
mama
says
he
was
in
love
with
your
sister
too
i
assure
you
it
was
a
great
compliment
if
he
was
for
he
hardly
ever
falls
in
love
with
any
body
is
mr
willoughby
much
known
in
your
part
of
somersetshire
said
elinor
oh
yes
extremely
well
that
is
i
do
not
believe
many
people
are
acquainted
with
him
because
combe
magna
is
so
far
off
but
they
all
think
him
extremely
agreeable
i
assure
you
nobody
is
more
liked
than
mr
willoughby
wherever
he
goes
and
so
you
may
tell
your
sister
she
is
a
monstrous
lucky
girl
to
get
him
upon
my
honour
not
but
that
he
is
much
more
lucky
in
getting
her
because
she
is
so
very
handsome
and
agreeable
that
nothing
can
be
good
enough
for
her
however
i
don
t
think
her
hardly
at
all
handsomer
than
you
i
assure
you
for
i
think
you
both
excessively
pretty
and
so
does
mr
palmer
too
i
am
sure
though
we
could
not
get
him
to
own
it
last
night
mrs
palmer
s
information
respecting
willoughby
was
not
very
material
but
any
testimony
in
his
favour
however
small
was
pleasing
to
her
i
am
so
glad
we
are
got
acquainted
at
last
continued
charlotte
and
now
i
hope
we
shall
always
be
great
friends
you
can
t
think
how
much
i
longed
to
see
you
it
is
so
delightful
that
you
should
live
at
the
cottage
nothing
can
be
like
it
to
be
sure
and
i
am
so
glad
your
sister
is
going
to
be
well
married
i
hope
you
will
be
a
great
deal
at
combe
magna
it
is
a
sweet
place
by
all
accounts
you
have
been
long
acquainted
with
colonel
brandon
have
not
you
yes
a
great
while
ever
since
my
sister
married
he
was
a
particular
friend
of
sir
john
s
i
believe
she
added
in
a
low
voice
he
would
have
been
very
glad
to
have
had
me
if
he
could
sir
john
and
lady
middleton
wished
it
very
much
but
mama
did
not
think
the
match
good
enough
for
me
otherwise
sir
john
would
have
mentioned
it
to
the
colonel
and
we
should
have
been
married
immediately
did
not
colonel
brandon
know
of
sir
john
s
proposal
to
your
mother
before
it
was
made
had
he
never
owned
his
affection
to
yourself
oh
no
but
if
mama
had
not
objected
to
it
i
dare
say
he
would
have
liked
it
of
all
things
he
had
not
seen
me
then
above
twice
for
it
was
before
i
left
school
however
i
am
much
happier
as
i
am
mr
palmer
is
the
kind
of
man
i
like
the
palmers
returned
to
cleveland
the
next
day
and
the
two
families
at
barton
were
again
left
to
entertain
each
other
but
this
did
not
last
long
elinor
had
hardly
got
their
last
visitors
out
of
her
head
had
hardly
done
wondering
at
charlotte
s
being
so
happy
without
a
cause
at
mr
palmer
s
acting
so
simply
with
good
abilities
and
at
the
strange
unsuitableness
which
often
existed
between
husband
and
wife
before
sir
john
s
and
mrs
jennings
s
active
zeal
in
the
cause
of
society
procured
her
some
other
new
acquaintance
to
see
and
observe
in
a
morning
s
excursion
to
exeter
they
had
met
with
two
young
ladies
whom
mrs
jennings
had
the
satisfaction
of
discovering
to
be
her
relations
and
this
was
enough
for
sir
john
to
invite
them
directly
to
the
park
as
soon
as
their
present
engagements
at
exeter
were
over
their
engagements
at
exeter
instantly
gave
way
before
such
an
invitation
and
lady
middleton
was
thrown
into
no
little
alarm
on
the
return
of
sir
john
by
hearing
that
she
was
very
soon
to
receive
a
visit
from
two
girls
whom
she
had
never
seen
in
her
life
and
of
whose
elegance
whose
tolerable
gentility
even
she
could
have
no
proof
for
the
assurances
of
her
husband
and
mother
on
that
subject
went
for
nothing
at
all
their
being
her
relations
too
made
it
so
much
the
worse
and
mrs
jennings
s
attempts
at
consolation
were
therefore
unfortunately
founded
when
she
advised
her
daughter
not
to
care
about
their
being
so
fashionable
because
they
were
all
cousins
and
must
put
up
with
one
another
as
it
was
impossible
however
now
to
prevent
their
coming
lady
middleton
resigned
herself
to
the
idea
of
it
with
all
the
philosophy
of
a
well
bred
woman
contenting
herself
with
merely
giving
her
husband
a
gentle
reprimand
on
the
subject
five
or
six
times
every
day
the
young
ladies
arrived
their
appearance
was
by
no
means
ungenteel
or
unfashionable
their
dress
was
very
smart
their
manners
very
civil
they
were
delighted
with
the
house
and
in
raptures
with
the
furniture
and
they
happened
to
be
so
doatingly
fond
of
children
that
lady
middleton
s
good
opinion
was
engaged
in
their
favour
before
they
had
been
an
hour
at
the
park
she
declared
them
to
be
very
agreeable
girls
indeed
which
for
her
ladyship
was
enthusiastic
admiration
sir
john
s
confidence
in
his
own
judgment
rose
with
this
animated
praise
and
he
set
off
directly
for
the
cottage
to
tell
the
miss
dashwoods
of
the
miss
steeles
arrival
and
to
assure
them
of
their
being
the
sweetest
girls
in
the
world
from
such
commendation
as
this
however
there
was
not
much
to
be
learned
elinor
well
knew
that
the
sweetest
girls
in
the
world
were
to
be
met
with
in
every
part
of
england
under
every
possible
variation
of
form
face
temper
and
understanding
sir
john
wanted
the
whole
family
to
walk
to
the
park
directly
and
look
at
his
guests
benevolent
philanthropic
man
it
was
painful
to
him
even
to
keep
a
third
cousin
to
himself
do
come
now
said
he
pray
come
you
must
come
i
declare
you
shall
come
you
can
t
think
how
you
will
like
them
lucy
is
monstrous
pretty
and
so
good
humoured
and
agreeable
the
children
are
all
hanging
about
her
already
as
if
she
was
an
old
acquaintance
and
they
both
long
to
see
you
of
all
things
for
they
have
heard
at
exeter
that
you
are
the
most
beautiful
creatures
in
the
world
and
i
have
told
them
it
is
all
very
true
and
a
great
deal
more
you
will
be
delighted
with
them
i
am
sure
they
have
brought
the
whole
coach
full
of
playthings
for
the
children
how
can
you
be
so
cross
as
not
to
come
why
they
are
your
cousins
you
know
after
a
fashion
you
are
my
cousins
and
they
are
my
wife
s
so
you
must
be
related
but
sir
john
could
not
prevail
he
could
only
obtain
a
promise
of
their
calling
at
the
park
within
a
day
or
two
and
then
left
them
in
amazement
at
their
indifference
to
walk
home
and
boast
anew
of
their
attractions
to
the
miss
steeles
as
he
had
been
already
boasting
of
the
miss
steeles
to
them
when
their
promised
visit
to
the
park
and
consequent
introduction
to
these
young
ladies
took
place
they
found
in
the
appearance
of
the
eldest
who
was
nearly
thirty
with
a
very
plain
and
not
a
sensible
face
nothing
to
admire
but
in
the
other
who
was
not
more
than
two
or
three
and
twenty
they
acknowledged
considerable
beauty
her
features
were
pretty
and
she
had
a
sharp
quick
eye
and
a
smartness
of
air
which
though
it
did
not
give
actual
elegance
or
grace
gave
distinction
to
her
person
their
manners
were
particularly
civil
and
elinor
soon
allowed
them
credit
for
some
kind
of
sense
when
she
saw
with
what
constant
and
judicious
attention
they
were
making
themselves
agreeable
to
lady
middleton
with
her
children
they
were
in
continual
raptures
extolling
their
beauty
courting
their
notice
and
humouring
their
whims
and
such
of
their
time
as
could
be
spared
from
the
importunate
demands
which
this
politeness
made
on
it
was
spent
in
admiration
of
whatever
her
ladyship
was
doing
if
she
happened
to
be
doing
any
thing
or
in
taking
patterns
of
some
elegant
new
dress
in
which
her
appearance
the
day
before
had
thrown
them
into
unceasing
delight
fortunately
for
those
who
pay
their
court
through
such
foibles
a
fond
mother
though
in
pursuit
of
praise
for
her
children
the
most
rapacious
of
human
beings
is
likewise
the
most
credulous
her
demands
are
exorbitant
but
she
will
swallow
any
thing
and
the
excessive
affection
and
endurance
of
the
miss
steeles
towards
her
offspring
were
viewed
therefore
by
lady
middleton
without
the
smallest
surprise
or
distrust
she
saw
with
maternal
complacency
all
the
impertinent
encroachments
and
mischievous
tricks
to
which
her
cousins
submitted
she
saw
their
sashes
untied
their
hair
pulled
about
their
ears
their
work
bags
searched
and
their
knives
and
scissors
stolen
away
and
felt
no
doubt
of
its
being
a
reciprocal
enjoyment
it
suggested
no
other
surprise
than
that
elinor
and
marianne
should
sit
so
composedly
by
without
claiming
a
share
in
what
was
passing
john
is
in
such
spirits
today
said
she
on
his
taking
miss
steeles
s
pocket
handkerchief
and
throwing
it
out
of
window
he
is
full
of
monkey
tricks
and
soon
afterwards
on
the
second
boy
s
violently
pinching
one
of
the
same
lady
s
fingers
she
fondly
observed
how
playful
william
is
and
here
is
my
sweet
little
annamaria
she
added
tenderly
caressing
a
little
girl
of
three
years
old
who
had
not
made
a
noise
for
the
last
two
minutes
and
she
is
always
so
gentle
and
quiet
never
was
there
such
a
quiet
little
thing
but
unfortunately
in
bestowing
these
embraces
a
pin
in
her
ladyship
s
head
dress
slightly
scratching
the
child
s
neck
produced
from
this
pattern
of
gentleness
such
violent
screams
as
could
hardly
be
outdone
by
any
creature
professedly
noisy
the
mother
s
consternation
was
excessive
but
it
could
not
surpass
the
alarm
of
the
miss
steeles
and
every
thing
was
done
by
all
three
in
so
critical
an
emergency
which
affection
could
suggest
as
likely
to
assuage
the
agonies
of
the
little
sufferer
she
was
seated
in
her
mother
s
lap
covered
with
kisses
her
wound
bathed
with
lavender
water
by
one
of
the
miss
steeles
who
was
on
her
knees
to
attend
her
and
her
mouth
stuffed
with
sugar
plums
by
the
other
with
such
a
reward
for
her
tears
the
child
was
too
wise
to
cease
crying
she
still
screamed
and
sobbed
lustily
kicked
her
two
brothers
for
offering
to
touch
her
and
all
their
united
soothings
were
ineffectual
till
lady
middleton
luckily
remembering
that
in
a
scene
of
similar
distress
last
week
some
apricot
marmalade
had
been
successfully
applied
for
a
bruised
temple
the
same
remedy
was
eagerly
proposed
for
this
unfortunate
scratch
and
a
slight
intermission
of
screams
in
the
young
lady
on
hearing
it
gave
them
reason
to
hope
that
it
would
not
be
rejected
she
was
carried
out
of
the
room
therefore
in
her
mother
s
arms
in
quest
of
this
medicine
and
as
the
two
boys
chose
to
follow
though
earnestly
entreated
by
their
mother
to
stay
behind
the
four
young
ladies
were
left
in
a
quietness
which
the
room
had
not
known
for
many
hours
poor
little
creatures
said
miss
steele
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
it
might
have
been
a
very
sad
accident
yet
i
hardly
know
how
cried
marianne
unless
it
had
been
under
totally
different
circumstances
but
this
is
the
usual
way
of
heightening
alarm
where
there
is
nothing
to
be
alarmed
at
in
reality
what
a
sweet
woman
lady
middleton
is
said
lucy
steele
marianne
was
silent
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
say
what
she
did
not
feel
however
trivial
the
occasion
and
upon
elinor
therefore
the
whole
task
of
telling
lies
when
politeness
required
it
always
fell
she
did
her
best
when
thus
called
on
by
speaking
of
lady
middleton
with
more
warmth
than
she
felt
though
with
far
less
than
miss
lucy
and
sir
john
too
cried
the
elder
sister
what
a
charming
man
he
is
here
too
miss
dashwood
s
commendation
being
only
simple
and
just
came
in
without
any
eclat
she
merely
observed
that
he
was
perfectly
good
humoured
and
friendly
and
what
a
charming
little
family
they
have
i
never
saw
such
fine
children
in
my
life
i
declare
i
quite
doat
upon
them
already
and
indeed
i
am
always
distractedly
fond
of
children
i
should
guess
so
said
elinor
with
a
smile
from
what
i
have
witnessed
this
morning
i
have
a
notion
said
lucy
you
think
the
little
middletons
rather
too
much
indulged
perhaps
they
may
be
the
outside
of
enough
but
it
is
so
natural
in
lady
middleton
and
for
my
part
i
love
to
see
children
full
of
life
and
spirits
i
cannot
bear
them
if
they
are
tame
and
quiet
i
confess
replied
elinor
that
while
i
am
at
barton
park
i
never
think
of
tame
and
quiet
children
with
any
abhorrence
a
short
pause
succeeded
this
speech
which
was
first
broken
by
miss
steele
who
seemed
very
much
disposed
for
conversation
and
who
now
said
rather
abruptly
and
how
do
you
like
devonshire
miss
dashwood
i
suppose
you
were
very
sorry
to
leave
sussex
in
some
surprise
at
the
familiarity
of
this
question
or
at
least
of
the
manner
in
which
it
was
spoken
elinor
replied
that
she
was
norland
is
a
prodigious
beautiful
place
is
not
it
added
miss
steele
we
have
heard
sir
john
admire
it
excessively
said
lucy
who
seemed
to
think
some
apology
necessary
for
the
freedom
of
her
sister
i
think
every
one
must
admire
it
replied
elinor
who
ever
saw
the
place
though
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
any
one
can
estimate
its
beauties
as
we
do
and
had
you
a
great
many
smart
beaux
there
i
suppose
you
have
not
so
many
in
this
part
of
the
world
for
my
part
i
think
they
are
a
vast
addition
always
but
why
should
you
think
said
lucy
looking
ashamed
of
her
sister
that
there
are
not
as
many
genteel
young
men
in
devonshire
as
sussex
nay
my
dear
i
m
sure
i
don
t
pretend
to
say
that
there
an
t
i
m
sure
there
s
a
vast
many
smart
beaux
in
exeter
but
you
know
how
could
i
tell
what
smart
beaux
there
might
be
about
norland
and
i
was
only
afraid
the
miss
dashwoods
might
find
it
dull
at
barton
if
they
had
not
so
many
as
they
used
to
have
but
perhaps
you
young
ladies
may
not
care
about
the
beaux
and
had
as
lief
be
without
them
as
with
them
for
my
part
i
think
they
are
vastly
agreeable
provided
they
dress
smart
and
behave
civil
but
i
can
t
bear
to
see
them
dirty
and
nasty
now
there
s
mr
rose
at
exeter
a
prodigious
smart
young
man
quite
a
beau
clerk
to
mr
simpson
you
know
and
yet
if
you
do
but
meet
him
of
a
morning
he
is
not
fit
to
be
seen
i
suppose
your
brother
was
quite
a
beau
miss
dashwood
before
he
married
as
he
was
so
rich
upon
my
word
replied
elinor
i
cannot
tell
you
for
i
do
not
perfectly
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
word
but
this
i
can
say
that
if
he
ever
was
a
beau
before
he
married
he
is
one
still
for
there
is
not
the
smallest
alteration
in
him
oh
dear
one
never
thinks
of
married
men
s
being
beaux
they
have
something
else
to
do
lord
anne
cried
her
sister
you
can
talk
of
nothing
but
beaux
you
will
make
miss
dashwood
believe
you
think
of
nothing
else
and
then
to
turn
the
discourse
she
began
admiring
the
house
and
the
furniture
this
specimen
of
the
miss
steeles
was
enough
the
vulgar
freedom
and
folly
of
the
eldest
left
her
no
recommendation
and
as
elinor
was
not
blinded
by
the
beauty
or
the
shrewd
look
of
the
youngest
to
her
want
of
real
elegance
and
artlessness
she
left
the
house
without
any
wish
of
knowing
them
better
not
so
the
miss
steeles
they
came
from
exeter
well
provided
with
admiration
for
the
use
of
sir
john
middleton
his
family
and
all
his
relations
and
no
niggardly
proportion
was
now
dealt
out
to
his
fair
cousins
whom
they
declared
to
be
the
most
beautiful
elegant
accomplished
and
agreeable
girls
they
had
ever
beheld
and
with
whom
they
were
particularly
anxious
to
be
better
acquainted
and
to
be
better
acquainted
therefore
elinor
soon
found
was
their
inevitable
lot
for
as
sir
john
was
entirely
on
the
side
of
the
miss
steeles
their
party
would
be
too
strong
for
opposition
and
that
kind
of
intimacy
must
be
submitted
to
which
consists
of
sitting
an
hour
or
two
together
in
the
same
room
almost
every
day
sir
john
could
do
no
more
but
he
did
not
know
that
any
more
was
required
to
be
together
was
in
his
opinion
to
be
intimate
and
while
his
continual
schemes
for
their
meeting
were
effectual
he
had
not
a
doubt
of
their
being
established
friends
to
do
him
justice
he
did
every
thing
in
his
power
to
promote
their
unreserve
by
making
the
miss
steeles
acquainted
with
whatever
he
knew
or
supposed
of
his
cousins
situations
in
the
most
delicate
particulars
and
elinor
had
not
seen
them
more
than
twice
before
the
eldest
of
them
wished
her
joy
on
her
sister
s
having
been
so
lucky
as
to
make
a
conquest
of
a
very
smart
beau
since
she
came
to
barton
twill
be
a
fine
thing
to
have
her
married
so
young
to
be
sure
said
she
and
i
hear
he
is
quite
a
beau
and
prodigious
handsome
and
i
hope
you
may
have
as
good
luck
yourself
soon
but
perhaps
you
may
have
a
friend
in
the
corner
already
elinor
could
not
suppose
that
sir
john
would
be
more
nice
in
proclaiming
his
suspicions
of
her
regard
for
edward
than
he
had
been
with
respect
to
marianne
indeed
it
was
rather
his
favourite
joke
of
the
two
as
being
somewhat
newer
and
more
conjectural
and
since
edward
s
visit
they
had
never
dined
together
without
his
drinking
to
her
best
affections
with
so
much
significancy
and
so
many
nods
and
winks
as
to
excite
general
attention
the
letter
f
had
been
likewise
invariably
brought
forward
and
found
productive
of
such
countless
jokes
that
its
character
as
the
wittiest
letter
in
the
alphabet
had
been
long
established
with
elinor
the
miss
steeles
as
she
expected
had
now
all
the
benefit
of
these
jokes
and
in
the
eldest
of
them
they
raised
a
curiosity
to
know
the
name
of
the
gentleman
alluded
to
which
though
often
impertinently
expressed
was
perfectly
of
a
piece
with
her
general
inquisitiveness
into
the
concerns
of
their
family
but
sir
john
did
not
sport
long
with
the
curiosity
which
he
delighted
to
raise
for
he
had
at
least
as
much
pleasure
in
telling
the
name
as
miss
steele
had
in
hearing
it
his
name
is
ferrars
said
he
in
a
very
audible
whisper
but
pray
do
not
tell
it
for
it
s
a
great
secret
ferrars
repeated
miss
steele
mr
ferrars
is
the
happy
man
is
he
what
your
sister
in
law
s
brother
miss
dashwood
a
very
agreeable
young
man
to
be
sure
i
know
him
very
well
how
can
you
say
so
anne
cried
lucy
who
generally
made
an
amendment
to
all
her
sister
s
assertions
though
we
have
seen
him
once
or
twice
at
my
uncle
s
it
is
rather
too
much
to
pretend
to
know
him
very
well
elinor
heard
all
this
with
attention
and
surprise
and
who
was
this
uncle
where
did
he
live
how
came
they
acquainted
she
wished
very
much
to
have
the
subject
continued
though
she
did
not
chuse
to
join
in
it
herself
but
nothing
more
of
it
was
said
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
thought
mrs
jennings
deficient
either
in
curiosity
after
petty
information
or
in
a
disposition
to
communicate
it
the
manner
in
which
miss
steele
had
spoken
of
edward
increased
her
curiosity
for
it
struck
her
as
being
rather
ill
natured
and
suggested
the
suspicion
of
that
lady
s
knowing
or
fancying
herself
to
know
something
to
his
disadvantage
but
her
curiosity
was
unavailing
for
no
farther
notice
was
taken
of
mr
ferrars
s
name
by
miss
steele
when
alluded
to
or
even
openly
mentioned
by
sir
john
marianne
who
had
never
much
toleration
for
any
thing
like
impertinence
vulgarity
inferiority
of
parts
or
even
difference
of
taste
from
herself
was
at
this
time
particularly
ill
disposed
from
the
state
of
her
spirits
to
be
pleased
with
the
miss
steeles
or
to
encourage
their
advances
and
to
the
invariable
coldness
of
her
behaviour
towards
them
which
checked
every
endeavour
at
intimacy
on
their
side
elinor
principally
attributed
that
preference
of
herself
which
soon
became
evident
in
the
manners
of
both
but
especially
of
lucy
who
missed
no
opportunity
of
engaging
her
in
conversation
or
of
striving
to
improve
their
acquaintance
by
an
easy
and
frank
communication
of
her
sentiments
lucy
was
naturally
clever
her
remarks
were
often
just
and
amusing
and
as
a
companion
for
half
an
hour
elinor
frequently
found
her
agreeable
but
her
powers
had
received
no
aid
from
education
she
was
ignorant
and
illiterate
and
her
deficiency
of
all
mental
improvement
her
want
of
information
in
the
most
common
particulars
could
not
be
concealed
from
miss
dashwood
in
spite
of
her
constant
endeavour
to
appear
to
advantage
elinor
saw
and
pitied
her
for
the
neglect
of
abilities
which
education
might
have
rendered
so
respectable
but
she
saw
with
less
tenderness
of
feeling
the
thorough
want
of
delicacy
of
rectitude
and
integrity
of
mind
which
her
attentions
her
assiduities
her
flatteries
at
the
park
betrayed
and
she
could
have
no
lasting
satisfaction
in
the
company
of
a
person
who
joined
insincerity
with
ignorance
whose
want
of
instruction
prevented
their
meeting
in
conversation
on
terms
of
equality
and
whose
conduct
toward
others
made
every
shew
of
attention
and
deference
towards
herself
perfectly
valueless
you
will
think
my
question
an
odd
one
i
dare
say
said
lucy
to
her
one
day
as
they
were
walking
together
from
the
park
to
the
cottage
but
pray
are
you
personally
acquainted
with
your
sister
in
law
s
mother
mrs
ferrars
elinor
did
think
the
question
a
very
odd
one
and
her
countenance
expressed
it
as
she
answered
that
she
had
never
seen
mrs
ferrars
indeed
replied
lucy
i
wonder
at
that
for
i
thought
you
must
have
seen
her
at
norland
sometimes
then
perhaps
you
cannot
tell
me
what
sort
of
a
woman
she
is
no
returned
elinor
cautious
of
giving
her
real
opinion
of
edward
s
mother
and
not
very
desirous
of
satisfying
what
seemed
impertinent
curiosity
i
know
nothing
of
her
i
am
sure
you
think
me
very
strange
for
enquiring
about
her
in
such
a
way
said
lucy
eyeing
elinor
attentively
as
she
spoke
but
perhaps
there
may
be
reasons
i
wish
i
might
venture
but
however
i
hope
you
will
do
me
the
justice
of
believing
that
i
do
not
mean
to
be
impertinent
elinor
made
her
a
civil
reply
and
they
walked
on
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
it
was
broken
by
lucy
who
renewed
the
subject
again
by
saying
with
some
hesitation
i
cannot
bear
to
have
you
think
me
impertinently
curious
i
am
sure
i
would
rather
do
any
thing
in
the
world
than
be
thought
so
by
a
person
whose
good
opinion
is
so
well
worth
having
as
yours
and
i
am
sure
i
should
not
have
the
smallest
fear
of
trusting
you
indeed
i
should
be
very
glad
of
your
advice
how
to
manage
in
such
an
uncomfortable
situation
as
i
am
but
however
there
is
no
occasion
to
trouble
you
i
am
sorry
you
do
not
happen
to
know
mrs
ferrars
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
said
elinor
in
great
astonishment
if
it
could
be
of
any
use
to
you
to
know
my
opinion
of
her
but
really
i
never
understood
that
you
were
at
all
connected
with
that
family
and
therefore
i
am
a
little
surprised
i
confess
at
so
serious
an
inquiry
into
her
character
i
dare
say
you
are
and
i
am
sure
i
do
not
at
all
wonder
at
it
but
if
i
dared
tell
you
all
you
would
not
be
so
much
surprised
mrs
ferrars
is
certainly
nothing
to
me
at
present
but
the
time
may
come
how
soon
it
will
come
must
depend
upon
herself
when
we
may
be
very
intimately
connected
she
looked
down
as
she
said
this
amiably
bashful
with
only
one
side
glance
at
her
companion
to
observe
its
effect
on
her
good
heavens
cried
elinor
what
do
you
mean
are
you
acquainted
with
mr
robert
ferrars
can
you
be
and
she
did
not
feel
much
delighted
with
the
idea
of
such
a
sister
in
law
no
replied
lucy
not
to
mr
robert
ferrars
i
never
saw
him
in
my
life
but
fixing
her
eyes
upon
elinor
to
his
eldest
brother
what
felt
elinor
at
that
moment
astonishment
that
would
have
been
as
painful
as
it
was
strong
had
not
an
immediate
disbelief
of
the
assertion
attended
it
she
turned
towards
lucy
in
silent
amazement
unable
to
divine
the
reason
or
object
of
such
a
declaration
and
though
her
complexion
varied
she
stood
firm
in
incredulity
and
felt
in
no
danger
of
an
hysterical
fit
or
a
swoon
you
may
well
be
surprised
continued
lucy
for
to
be
sure
you
could
have
had
no
idea
of
it
before
for
i
dare
say
he
never
dropped
the
smallest
hint
of
it
to
you
or
any
of
your
family
because
it
was
always
meant
to
be
a
great
secret
and
i
am
sure
has
been
faithfully
kept
so
by
me
to
this
hour
not
a
soul
of
all
my
relations
know
of
it
but
anne
and
i
never
should
have
mentioned
it
to
you
if
i
had
not
felt
the
greatest
dependence
in
the
world
upon
your
secrecy
and
i
really
thought
my
behaviour
in
asking
so
many
questions
about
mrs
ferrars
must
seem
so
odd
that
it
ought
to
be
explained
and
i
do
not
think
mr
ferrars
can
be
displeased
when
he
knows
i
have
trusted
you
because
i
know
he
has
the
highest
opinion
in
the
world
of
all
your
family
and
looks
upon
yourself
and
the
other
miss
dashwoods
quite
as
his
own
sisters
she
paused
elinor
for
a
few
moments
remained
silent
her
astonishment
at
what
she
heard
was
at
first
too
great
for
words
but
at
length
forcing
herself
to
speak
and
to
speak
cautiously
she
said
with
calmness
of
manner
which
tolerably
well
concealed
her
surprise
and
solicitude
may
i
ask
if
your
engagement
is
of
long
standing
we
have
been
engaged
these
four
years
four
years
yes
elinor
though
greatly
shocked
still
felt
unable
to
believe
it
i
did
not
know
said
she
that
you
were
even
acquainted
till
the
other
day
our
acquaintance
however
is
of
many
years
date
he
was
under
my
uncle
s
care
you
know
a
considerable
while
your
uncle
yes
mr
pratt
did
you
never
hear
him
talk
of
mr
pratt
i
think
i
have
replied
elinor
with
an
exertion
of
spirits
which
increased
with
her
increase
of
emotion
he
was
four
years
with
my
uncle
who
lives
at
longstaple
near
plymouth
it
was
there
our
acquaintance
begun
for
my
sister
and
me
was
often
staying
with
my
uncle
and
it
was
there
our
engagement
was
formed
though
not
till
a
year
after
he
had
quitted
as
a
pupil
but
he
was
almost
always
with
us
afterwards
i
was
very
unwilling
to
enter
into
it
as
you
may
imagine
without
the
knowledge
and
approbation
of
his
mother
but
i
was
too
young
and
loved
him
too
well
to
be
so
prudent
as
i
ought
to
have
been
though
you
do
not
know
him
so
well
as
me
miss
dashwood
you
must
have
seen
enough
of
him
to
be
sensible
he
is
very
capable
of
making
a
woman
sincerely
attached
to
him
certainly
answered
elinor
without
knowing
what
she
said
but
after
a
moment
s
reflection
she
added
with
revived
security
of
edward
s
honour
and
love
and
her
companion
s
falsehood
engaged
to
mr
edward
ferrars
i
confess
myself
so
totally
surprised
at
what
you
tell
me
that
really
i
beg
your
pardon
but
surely
there
must
be
some
mistake
of
person
or
name
we
cannot
mean
the
same
mr
ferrars
we
can
mean
no
other
cried
lucy
smiling
mr
edward
ferrars
the
eldest
son
of
mrs
ferrars
of
park
street
and
brother
of
your
sister
in
law
mrs
john
dashwood
is
the
person
i
mean
you
must
allow
that
i
am
not
likely
to
be
deceived
as
to
the
name
of
the
man
on
who
all
my
happiness
depends
it
is
strange
replied
elinor
in
a
most
painful
perplexity
that
i
should
never
have
heard
him
even
mention
your
name
no
considering
our
situation
it
was
not
strange
our
first
care
has
been
to
keep
the
matter
secret
you
knew
nothing
of
me
or
my
family
and
therefore
there
could
be
no
occasion
for
ever
mentioning
my
name
to
you
and
as
he
was
always
particularly
afraid
of
his
sister
s
suspecting
any
thing
that
was
reason
enough
for
his
not
mentioning
it
she
was
silent
elinor
s
security
sunk
but
her
self
command
did
not
sink
with
it
four
years
you
have
been
engaged
said
she
with
a
firm
voice
yes
and
heaven
knows
how
much
longer
we
may
have
to
wait
poor
edward
it
puts
him
quite
out
of
heart
then
taking
a
small
miniature
from
her
pocket
she
added
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
mistake
be
so
good
as
to
look
at
this
face
it
does
not
do
him
justice
to
be
sure
but
yet
i
think
you
cannot
be
deceived
as
to
the
person
it
was
drew
for
i
have
had
it
above
these
three
years
she
put
it
into
her
hands
as
she
spoke
and
when
elinor
saw
the
painting
whatever
other
doubts
her
fear
of
a
too
hasty
decision
or
her
wish
of
detecting
falsehood
might
suffer
to
linger
in
her
mind
she
could
have
none
of
its
being
edward
s
face
she
returned
it
almost
instantly
acknowledging
the
likeness
i
have
never
been
able
continued
lucy
to
give
him
my
picture
in
return
which
i
am
very
much
vexed
at
for
he
has
been
always
so
anxious
to
get
it
but
i
am
determined
to
set
for
it
the
very
first
opportunity
you
are
quite
in
the
right
replied
elinor
calmly
they
then
proceeded
a
few
paces
in
silence
lucy
spoke
first
i
am
sure
said
she
i
have
no
doubt
in
the
world
of
your
faithfully
keeping
this
secret
because
you
must
know
of
what
importance
it
is
to
us
not
to
have
it
reach
his
mother
for
she
would
never
approve
of
it
i
dare
say
i
shall
have
no
fortune
and
i
fancy
she
is
an
exceeding
proud
woman
i
certainly
did
not
seek
your
confidence
said
elinor
but
you
do
me
no
more
than
justice
in
imagining
that
i
may
be
depended
on
your
secret
is
safe
with
me
but
pardon
me
if
i
express
some
surprise
at
so
unnecessary
a
communication
you
must
at
least
have
felt
that
my
being
acquainted
with
it
could
not
add
to
its
safety
as
she
said
this
she
looked
earnestly
at
lucy
hoping
to
discover
something
in
her
countenance
perhaps
the
falsehood
of
the
greatest
part
of
what
she
had
been
saying
but
lucy
s
countenance
suffered
no
change
i
was
afraid
you
would
think
i
was
taking
a
great
liberty
with
you
said
she
in
telling
you
all
this
i
have
not
known
you
long
to
be
sure
personally
at
least
but
i
have
known
you
and
all
your
family
by
description
a
great
while
and
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
i
felt
almost
as
if
you
was
an
old
acquaintance
besides
in
the
present
case
i
really
thought
some
explanation
was
due
to
you
after
my
making
such
particular
inquiries
about
edward
s
mother
and
i
am
so
unfortunate
that
i
have
not
a
creature
whose
advice
i
can
ask
anne
is
the
only
person
that
knows
of
it
and
she
has
no
judgment
at
all
indeed
she
does
me
a
great
deal
more
harm
than
good
for
i
am
in
constant
fear
of
her
betraying
me
she
does
not
know
how
to
hold
her
tongue
as
you
must
perceive
and
i
am
sure
i
was
in
the
greatest
fright
in
the
world
t
other
day
when
edward
s
name
was
mentioned
by
sir
john
lest
she
should
out
with
it
all
you
can
t
think
how
much
i
go
through
in
my
mind
from
it
altogether
i
only
wonder
that
i
am
alive
after
what
i
have
suffered
for
edward
s
sake
these
last
four
years
every
thing
in
such
suspense
and
uncertainty
and
seeing
him
so
seldom
we
can
hardly
meet
above
twice
a
year
i
am
sure
i
wonder
my
heart
is
not
quite
broke
here
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
but
elinor
did
not
feel
very
compassionate
sometimes
continued
lucy
after
wiping
her
eyes
i
think
whether
it
would
not
be
better
for
us
both
to
break
off
the
matter
entirely
as
she
said
this
she
looked
directly
at
her
companion
but
then
at
other
times
i
have
not
resolution
enough
for
it
i
cannot
bear
the
thoughts
of
making
him
so
miserable
as
i
know
the
very
mention
of
such
a
thing
would
do
and
on
my
own
account
too
so
dear
as
he
is
to
me
i
don
t
think
i
could
be
equal
to
it
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
in
such
a
case
miss
dashwood
what
would
you
do
yourself
pardon
me
replied
elinor
startled
by
the
question
but
i
can
give
you
no
advice
under
such
circumstances
your
own
judgment
must
direct
you
to
be
sure
continued
lucy
after
a
few
minutes
silence
on
both
sides
his
mother
must
provide
for
him
sometime
or
other
but
poor
edward
is
so
cast
down
by
it
did
you
not
think
him
dreadful
low
spirited
when
he
was
at
barton
he
was
so
miserable
when
he
left
us
at
longstaple
to
go
to
you
that
i
was
afraid
you
would
think
him
quite
ill
did
he
come
from
your
uncle
s
then
when
he
visited
us
oh
yes
he
had
been
staying
a
fortnight
with
us
did
you
think
he
came
directly
from
town
no
replied
elinor
most
feelingly
sensible
of
every
fresh
circumstance
in
favour
of
lucy
s
veracity
i
remember
he
told
us
that
he
had
been
staying
a
fortnight
with
some
friends
near
plymouth
she
remembered
too
her
own
surprise
at
the
time
at
his
mentioning
nothing
farther
of
those
friends
at
his
total
silence
with
respect
even
to
their
names
did
not
you
think
him
sadly
out
of
spirits
repeated
lucy
we
did
indeed
particularly
so
when
he
first
arrived
i
begged
him
to
exert
himself
for
fear
you
should
suspect
what
was
the
matter
but
it
made
him
so
melancholy
not
being
able
to
stay
more
than
a
fortnight
with
us
and
seeing
me
so
much
affected
poor
fellow
i
am
afraid
it
is
just
the
same
with
him
now
for
he
writes
in
wretched
spirits
i
heard
from
him
just
before
i
left
exeter
taking
a
letter
from
her
pocket
and
carelessly
showing
the
direction
to
elinor
you
know
his
hand
i
dare
say
a
charming
one
it
is
but
that
is
not
written
so
well
as
usual
he
was
tired
i
dare
say
for
he
had
just
filled
the
sheet
to
me
as
full
as
possible
elinor
saw
that
it
was
his
hand
and
she
could
doubt
no
longer
this
picture
she
had
allowed
herself
to
believe
might
have
been
accidentally
obtained
it
might
not
have
been
edward
s
gift
but
a
correspondence
between
them
by
letter
could
subsist
only
under
a
positive
engagement
could
be
authorised
by
nothing
else
for
a
few
moments
she
was
almost
overcome
her
heart
sunk
within
her
and
she
could
hardly
stand
but
exertion
was
indispensably
necessary
and
she
struggled
so
resolutely
against
the
oppression
of
her
feelings
that
her
success
was
speedy
and
for
the
time
complete
writing
to
each
other
said
lucy
returning
the
letter
into
her
pocket
is
the
only
comfort
we
have
in
such
long
separations
yes
i
have
one
other
comfort
in
his
picture
but
poor
edward
has
not
even
that
if
he
had
but
my
picture
he
says
he
should
be
easy
i
gave
him
a
lock
of
my
hair
set
in
a
ring
when
he
was
at
longstaple
last
and
that
was
some
comfort
to
him
he
said
but
not
equal
to
a
picture
perhaps
you
might
notice
the
ring
when
you
saw
him
i
did
said
elinor
with
a
composure
of
voice
under
which
was
concealed
an
emotion
and
distress
beyond
any
thing
she
had
ever
felt
before
she
was
mortified
shocked
confounded
fortunately
for
her
they
had
now
reached
the
cottage
and
the
conversation
could
be
continued
no
farther
after
sitting
with
them
a
few
minutes
the
miss
steeles
returned
to
the
park
and
elinor
was
then
at
liberty
to
think
and
be
wretched
however
small
elinor
s
general
dependence
on
lucy
s
veracity
might
be
it
was
impossible
for
her
on
serious
reflection
to
suspect
it
in
the
present
case
where
no
temptation
could
be
answerable
to
the
folly
of
inventing
a
falsehood
of
such
a
description
what
lucy
had
asserted
to
be
true
therefore
elinor
could
not
dared
not
longer
doubt
supported
as
it
was
too
on
every
side
by
such
probabilities
and
proofs
and
contradicted
by
nothing
but
her
own
wishes
their
opportunity
of
acquaintance
in
the
house
of
mr
pratt
was
a
foundation
for
the
rest
at
once
indisputable
and
alarming
and
edward
s
visit
near
plymouth
his
melancholy
state
of
mind
his
dissatisfaction
at
his
own
prospects
his
uncertain
behaviour
towards
herself
the
intimate
knowledge
of
the
miss
steeles
as
to
norland
and
their
family
connections
which
had
often
surprised
her
the
picture
the
letter
the
ring
formed
altogether
such
a
body
of
evidence
as
overcame
every
fear
of
condemning
him
unfairly
and
established
as
a
fact
which
no
partiality
could
set
aside
his
ill
treatment
of
herself
her
resentment
of
such
behaviour
her
indignation
at
having
been
its
dupe
for
a
short
time
made
her
feel
only
for
herself
but
other
ideas
other
considerations
soon
arose
had
edward
been
intentionally
deceiving
her
had
he
feigned
a
regard
for
her
which
he
did
not
feel
was
his
engagement
to
lucy
an
engagement
of
the
heart
no
whatever
it
might
once
have
been
she
could
not
believe
it
such
at
present
his
affection
was
all
her
own
she
could
not
be
deceived
in
that
her
mother
sisters
fanny
all
had
been
conscious
of
his
regard
for
her
at
norland
it
was
not
an
illusion
of
her
own
vanity
he
certainly
loved
her
what
a
softener
of
the
heart
was
this
persuasion
how
much
could
it
not
tempt
her
to
forgive
he
had
been
blamable
highly
blamable
in
remaining
at
norland
after
he
first
felt
her
influence
over
him
to
be
more
than
it
ought
to
be
in
that
he
could
not
be
defended
but
if
he
had
injured
her
how
much
more
had
he
injured
himself
if
her
case
were
pitiable
his
was
hopeless
his
imprudence
had
made
her
miserable
for
a
while
but
it
seemed
to
have
deprived
himself
of
all
chance
of
ever
being
otherwise
she
might
in
time
regain
tranquillity
but
he
what
had
he
to
look
forward
to
could
he
ever
be
tolerably
happy
with
lucy
steele
could
he
were
his
affection
for
herself
out
of
the
question
with
his
integrity
his
delicacy
and
well
informed
mind
be
satisfied
with
a
wife
like
her
illiterate
artful
and
selfish
the
youthful
infatuation
of
nineteen
would
naturally
blind
him
to
every
thing
but
her
beauty
and
good
nature
but
the
four
succeeding
years
years
which
if
rationally
spent
give
such
improvement
to
the
understanding
must
have
opened
his
eyes
to
her
defects
of
education
while
the
same
period
of
time
spent
on
her
side
in
inferior
society
and
more
frivolous
pursuits
had
perhaps
robbed
her
of
that
simplicity
which
might
once
have
given
an
interesting
character
to
her
beauty
if
in
the
supposition
of
his
seeking
to
marry
herself
his
difficulties
from
his
mother
had
seemed
great
how
much
greater
were
they
now
likely
to
be
when
the
object
of
his
engagement
was
undoubtedly
inferior
in
connections
and
probably
inferior
in
fortune
to
herself
these
difficulties
indeed
with
a
heart
so
alienated
from
lucy
might
not
press
very
hard
upon
his
patience
but
melancholy
was
the
state
of
the
person
by
whom
the
expectation
of
family
opposition
and
unkindness
could
be
felt
as
a
relief
as
these
considerations
occurred
to
her
in
painful
succession
she
wept
for
him
more
than
for
herself
supported
by
the
conviction
of
having
done
nothing
to
merit
her
present
unhappiness
and
consoled
by
the
belief
that
edward
had
done
nothing
to
forfeit
her
esteem
she
thought
she
could
even
now
under
the
first
smart
of
the
heavy
blow
command
herself
enough
to
guard
every
suspicion
of
the
truth
from
her
mother
and
sisters
and
so
well
was
she
able
to
answer
her
own
expectations
that
when
she
joined
them
at
dinner
only
two
hours
after
she
had
first
suffered
the
extinction
of
all
her
dearest
hopes
no
one
would
have
supposed
from
the
appearance
of
the
sisters
that
elinor
was
mourning
in
secret
over
obstacles
which
must
divide
her
for
ever
from
the
object
of
her
love
and
that
marianne
was
internally
dwelling
on
the
perfections
of
a
man
of
whose
whole
heart
she
felt
thoroughly
possessed
and
whom
she
expected
to
see
in
every
carriage
which
drove
near
their
house
the
necessity
of
concealing
from
her
mother
and
marianne
what
had
been
entrusted
in
confidence
to
herself
though
it
obliged
her
to
unceasing
exertion
was
no
aggravation
of
elinor
s
distress
on
the
contrary
it
was
a
relief
to
her
to
be
spared
the
communication
of
what
would
give
such
affliction
to
them
and
to
be
saved
likewise
from
hearing
that
condemnation
of
edward
which
would
probably
flow
from
the
excess
of
their
partial
affection
for
herself
and
which
was
more
than
she
felt
equal
to
support
from
their
counsel
or
their
conversation
she
knew
she
could
receive
no
assistance
their
tenderness
and
sorrow
must
add
to
her
distress
while
her
self
command
would
neither
receive
encouragement
from
their
example
nor
from
their
praise
she
was
stronger
alone
and
her
own
good
sense
so
well
supported
her
that
her
firmness
was
as
unshaken
her
appearance
of
cheerfulness
as
invariable
as
with
regrets
so
poignant
and
so
fresh
it
was
possible
for
them
to
be
much
as
she
had
suffered
from
her
first
conversation
with
lucy
on
the
subject
she
soon
felt
an
earnest
wish
of
renewing
it
and
this
for
more
reasons
than
one
she
wanted
to
hear
many
particulars
of
their
engagement
repeated
again
she
wanted
more
clearly
to
understand
what
lucy
really
felt
for
edward
whether
there
were
any
sincerity
in
her
declaration
of
tender
regard
for
him
and
she
particularly
wanted
to
convince
lucy
by
her
readiness
to
enter
on
the
matter
again
and
her
calmness
in
conversing
on
it
that
she
was
no
otherwise
interested
in
it
than
as
a
friend
which
she
very
much
feared
her
involuntary
agitation
in
their
morning
discourse
must
have
left
at
least
doubtful
that
lucy
was
disposed
to
be
jealous
of
her
appeared
very
probable
it
was
plain
that
edward
had
always
spoken
highly
in
her
praise
not
merely
from
lucy
s
assertion
but
from
her
venturing
to
trust
her
on
so
short
a
personal
acquaintance
with
a
secret
so
confessedly
and
evidently
important
and
even
sir
john
s
joking
intelligence
must
have
had
some
weight
but
indeed
while
elinor
remained
so
well
assured
within
herself
of
being
really
beloved
by
edward
it
required
no
other
consideration
of
probabilities
to
make
it
natural
that
lucy
should
be
jealous
and
that
she
was
so
her
very
confidence
was
a
proof
what
other
reason
for
the
disclosure
of
the
affair
could
there
be
but
that
elinor
might
be
informed
by
it
of
lucy
s
superior
claims
on
edward
and
be
taught
to
avoid
him
in
future
she
had
little
difficulty
in
understanding
thus
much
of
her
rival
s
intentions
and
while
she
was
firmly
resolved
to
act
by
her
as
every
principle
of
honour
and
honesty
directed
to
combat
her
own
affection
for
edward
and
to
see
him
as
little
as
possible
she
could
not
deny
herself
the
comfort
of
endeavouring
to
convince
lucy
that
her
heart
was
unwounded
and
as
she
could
now
have
nothing
more
painful
to
hear
on
the
subject
than
had
already
been
told
she
did
not
mistrust
her
own
ability
of
going
through
a
repetition
of
particulars
with
composure
but
it
was
not
immediately
that
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
could
be
commanded
though
lucy
was
as
well
disposed
as
herself
to
take
advantage
of
any
that
occurred
for
the
weather
was
not
often
fine
enough
to
allow
of
their
joining
in
a
walk
where
they
might
most
easily
separate
themselves
from
the
others
and
though
they
met
at
least
every
other
evening
either
at
the
park
or
cottage
and
chiefly
at
the
former
they
could
not
be
supposed
to
meet
for
the
sake
of
conversation
such
a
thought
would
never
enter
either
sir
john
or
lady
middleton
s
head
and
therefore
very
little
leisure
was
ever
given
for
a
general
chat
and
none
at
all
for
particular
discourse
they
met
for
the
sake
of
eating
drinking
and
laughing
together
playing
at
cards
or
consequences
or
any
other
game
that
was
sufficiently
noisy
one
or
two
meetings
of
this
kind
had
taken
place
without
affording
elinor
any
chance
of
engaging
lucy
in
private
when
sir
john
called
at
the
cottage
one
morning
to
beg
in
the
name
of
charity
that
they
would
all
dine
with
lady
middleton
that
day
as
he
was
obliged
to
attend
the
club
at
exeter
and
she
would
otherwise
be
quite
alone
except
her
mother
and
the
two
miss
steeles
elinor
who
foresaw
a
fairer
opening
for
the
point
she
had
in
view
in
such
a
party
as
this
was
likely
to
be
more
at
liberty
among
themselves
under
the
tranquil
and
well
bred
direction
of
lady
middleton
than
when
her
husband
united
them
together
in
one
noisy
purpose
immediately
accepted
the
invitation
margaret
with
her
mother
s
permission
was
equally
compliant
and
marianne
though
always
unwilling
to
join
any
of
their
parties
was
persuaded
by
her
mother
who
could
not
bear
to
have
her
seclude
herself
from
any
chance
of
amusement
to
go
likewise
the
young
ladies
went
and
lady
middleton
was
happily
preserved
from
the
frightful
solitude
which
had
threatened
her
the
insipidity
of
the
meeting
was
exactly
such
as
elinor
had
expected
it
produced
not
one
novelty
of
thought
or
expression
and
nothing
could
be
less
interesting
than
the
whole
of
their
discourse
both
in
the
dining
parlour
and
drawing
room
to
the
latter
the
children
accompanied
them
and
while
they
remained
there
she
was
too
well
convinced
of
the
impossibility
of
engaging
lucy
s
attention
to
attempt
it
they
quitted
it
only
with
the
removal
of
the
tea
things
the
card
table
was
then
placed
and
elinor
began
to
wonder
at
herself
for
having
ever
entertained
a
hope
of
finding
time
for
conversation
at
the
park
they
all
rose
up
in
preparation
for
a
round
game
i
am
glad
said
lady
middleton
to
lucy
you
are
not
going
to
finish
poor
little
annamaria
s
basket
this
evening
for
i
am
sure
it
must
hurt
your
eyes
to
work
filigree
by
candlelight
and
we
will
make
the
dear
little
love
some
amends
for
her
disappointment
to
morrow
and
then
i
hope
she
will
not
much
mind
it
this
hint
was
enough
lucy
recollected
herself
instantly
and
replied
indeed
you
are
very
much
mistaken
lady
middleton
i
am
only
waiting
to
know
whether
you
can
make
your
party
without
me
or
i
should
have
been
at
my
filigree
already
i
would
not
disappoint
the
little
angel
for
all
the
world
and
if
you
want
me
at
the
card
table
now
i
am
resolved
to
finish
the
basket
after
supper
you
are
very
good
i
hope
it
won
t
hurt
your
eyes
will
you
ring
the
bell
for
some
working
candles
my
poor
little
girl
would
be
sadly
disappointed
i
know
if
the
basket
was
not
finished
tomorrow
for
though
i
told
her
it
certainly
would
not
i
am
sure
she
depends
upon
having
it
done
lucy
directly
drew
her
work
table
near
her
and
reseated
herself
with
an
alacrity
and
cheerfulness
which
seemed
to
infer
that
she
could
taste
no
greater
delight
than
in
making
a
filigree
basket
for
a
spoilt
child
lady
middleton
proposed
a
rubber
of
casino
to
the
others
no
one
made
any
objection
but
marianne
who
with
her
usual
inattention
to
the
forms
of
general
civility
exclaimed
your
ladyship
will
have
the
goodness
to
excuse
me
you
know
i
detest
cards
i
shall
go
to
the
piano
forte
i
have
not
touched
it
since
it
was
tuned
and
without
farther
ceremony
she
turned
away
and
walked
to
the
instrument
lady
middleton
looked
as
if
she
thanked
heaven
that
she
had
never
made
so
rude
a
speech
marianne
can
never
keep
long
from
that
instrument
you
know
ma
am
said
elinor
endeavouring
to
smooth
away
the
offence
and
i
do
not
much
wonder
at
it
for
it
is
the
very
best
toned
piano
forte
i
ever
heard
the
remaining
five
were
now
to
draw
their
cards
perhaps
continued
elinor
if
i
should
happen
to
cut
out
i
may
be
of
some
use
to
miss
lucy
steele
in
rolling
her
papers
for
her
and
there
is
so
much
still
to
be
done
to
the
basket
that
it
must
be
impossible
i
think
for
her
labour
singly
to
finish
it
this
evening
i
should
like
the
work
exceedingly
if
she
would
allow
me
a
share
in
it
indeed
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
help
cried
lucy
for
i
find
there
is
more
to
be
done
to
it
than
i
thought
there
was
and
it
would
be
a
shocking
thing
to
disappoint
dear
annamaria
after
all
oh
that
would
be
terrible
indeed
said
miss
steele
dear
little
soul
how
i
do
love
her
you
are
very
kind
said
lady
middleton
to
elinor
and
as
you
really
like
the
work
perhaps
you
will
be
as
well
pleased
not
to
cut
in
till
another
rubber
or
will
you
take
your
chance
now
elinor
joyfully
profited
by
the
first
of
these
proposals
and
thus
by
a
little
of
that
address
which
marianne
could
never
condescend
to
practise
gained
her
own
end
and
pleased
lady
middleton
at
the
same
time
lucy
made
room
for
her
with
ready
attention
and
the
two
fair
rivals
were
thus
seated
side
by
side
at
the
same
table
and
with
the
utmost
harmony
engaged
in
forwarding
the
same
work
the
pianoforte
at
which
marianne
wrapped
up
in
her
own
music
and
her
own
thoughts
had
by
this
time
forgotten
that
any
body
was
in
the
room
besides
herself
was
luckily
so
near
them
that
miss
dashwood
now
judged
she
might
safely
under
the
shelter
of
its
noise
introduce
the
interesting
subject
without
any
risk
of
being
heard
at
the
card
table
in
a
firm
though
cautious
tone
elinor
thus
began
i
should
be
undeserving
of
the
confidence
you
have
honoured
me
with
if
i
felt
no
desire
for
its
continuance
or
no
farther
curiosity
on
its
subject
i
will
not
apologize
therefore
for
bringing
it
forward
again
thank
you
cried
lucy
warmly
for
breaking
the
ice
you
have
set
my
heart
at
ease
by
it
for
i
was
somehow
or
other
afraid
i
had
offended
you
by
what
i
told
you
that
monday
offended
me
how
could
you
suppose
so
believe
me
and
elinor
spoke
it
with
the
truest
sincerity
nothing
could
be
farther
from
my
intention
than
to
give
you
such
an
idea
could
you
have
a
motive
for
the
trust
that
was
not
honourable
and
flattering
to
me
and
yet
i
do
assure
you
replied
lucy
her
little
sharp
eyes
full
of
meaning
there
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
coldness
and
displeasure
in
your
manner
that
made
me
quite
uncomfortable
i
felt
sure
that
you
was
angry
with
me
and
have
been
quarrelling
with
myself
ever
since
for
having
took
such
a
liberty
as
to
trouble
you
with
my
affairs
but
i
am
very
glad
to
find
it
was
only
my
own
fancy
and
that
you
really
do
not
blame
me
if
you
knew
what
a
consolation
it
was
to
me
to
relieve
my
heart
speaking
to
you
of
what
i
am
always
thinking
of
every
moment
of
my
life
your
compassion
would
make
you
overlook
every
thing
else
i
am
sure
indeed
i
can
easily
believe
that
it
was
a
very
great
relief
to
you
to
acknowledge
your
situation
to
me
and
be
assured
that
you
shall
never
have
reason
to
repent
it
your
case
is
a
very
unfortunate
one
you
seem
to
me
to
be
surrounded
with
difficulties
and
you
will
have
need
of
all
your
mutual
affection
to
support
you
under
them
mr
ferrars
i
believe
is
entirely
dependent
on
his
mother
he
has
only
two
thousand
pounds
of
his
own
it
would
be
madness
to
marry
upon
that
though
for
my
own
part
i
could
give
up
every
prospect
of
more
without
a
sigh
i
have
been
always
used
to
a
very
small
income
and
could
struggle
with
any
poverty
for
him
but
i
love
him
too
well
to
be
the
selfish
means
of
robbing
him
perhaps
of
all
that
his
mother
might
give
him
if
he
married
to
please
her
we
must
wait
it
may
be
for
many
years
with
almost
every
other
man
in
the
world
it
would
be
an
alarming
prospect
but
edward
s
affection
and
constancy
nothing
can
deprive
me
of
i
know
that
conviction
must
be
every
thing
to
you
and
he
is
undoubtedly
supported
by
the
same
trust
in
your
s
if
the
strength
of
your
reciprocal
attachment
had
failed
as
between
many
people
and
under
many
circumstances
it
naturally
would
during
a
four
years
engagement
your
situation
would
have
been
pitiable
indeed
lucy
here
looked
up
but
elinor
was
careful
in
guarding
her
countenance
from
every
expression
that
could
give
her
words
a
suspicious
tendency
edward
s
love
for
me
said
lucy
has
been
pretty
well
put
to
the
test
by
our
long
very
long
absence
since
we
were
first
engaged
and
it
has
stood
the
trial
so
well
that
i
should
be
unpardonable
to
doubt
it
now
i
can
safely
say
that
he
has
never
gave
me
one
moment
s
alarm
on
that
account
from
the
first
elinor
hardly
knew
whether
to
smile
or
sigh
at
this
assertion
lucy
went
on
i
am
rather
of
a
jealous
temper
too
by
nature
and
from
our
different
situations
in
life
from
his
being
so
much
more
in
the
world
than
me
and
our
continual
separation
i
was
enough
inclined
for
suspicion
to
have
found
out
the
truth
in
an
instant
if
there
had
been
the
slightest
alteration
in
his
behaviour
to
me
when
we
met
or
any
lowness
of
spirits
that
i
could
not
account
for
or
if
he
had
talked
more
of
one
lady
than
another
or
seemed
in
any
respect
less
happy
at
longstaple
than
he
used
to
be
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
i
am
particularly
observant
or
quick
sighted
in
general
but
in
such
a
case
i
am
sure
i
could
not
be
deceived
all
this
thought
elinor
is
very
pretty
but
it
can
impose
upon
neither
of
us
but
what
said
she
after
a
short
silence
are
your
views
or
have
you
none
but
that
of
waiting
for
mrs
ferrars
s
death
which
is
a
melancholy
and
shocking
extremity
is
her
son
determined
to
submit
to
this
and
to
all
the
tediousness
of
the
many
years
of
suspense
in
which
it
may
involve
you
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
her
displeasure
for
a
while
by
owning
the
truth
if
we
could
be
certain
that
it
would
be
only
for
a
while
but
mrs
ferrars
is
a
very
headstrong
proud
woman
and
in
her
first
fit
of
anger
upon
hearing
it
would
very
likely
secure
every
thing
to
robert
and
the
idea
of
that
for
edward
s
sake
frightens
away
all
my
inclination
for
hasty
measures
and
for
your
own
sake
too
or
you
are
carrying
your
disinterestedness
beyond
reason
lucy
looked
at
elinor
again
and
was
silent
do
you
know
mr
robert
ferrars
asked
elinor
not
at
all
i
never
saw
him
but
i
fancy
he
is
very
unlike
his
brother
silly
and
a
great
coxcomb
a
great
coxcomb
repeated
miss
steele
whose
ear
had
caught
those
words
by
a
sudden
pause
in
marianne
s
music
oh
they
are
talking
of
their
favourite
beaux
i
dare
say
no
sister
cried
lucy
you
are
mistaken
there
our
favourite
beaux
are
not
great
coxcombs
i
can
answer
for
it
that
miss
dashwood
s
is
not
said
mrs
jennings
laughing
heartily
for
he
is
one
of
the
modestest
prettiest
behaved
young
men
i
ever
saw
but
as
for
lucy
she
is
such
a
sly
little
creature
there
is
no
finding
out
who
she
likes
oh
cried
miss
steele
looking
significantly
round
at
them
i
dare
say
lucy
s
beau
is
quite
as
modest
and
pretty
behaved
as
miss
dashwood
s
elinor
blushed
in
spite
of
herself
lucy
bit
her
lip
and
looked
angrily
at
her
sister
a
mutual
silence
took
place
for
some
time
lucy
first
put
an
end
to
it
by
saying
in
a
lower
tone
though
marianne
was
then
giving
them
the
powerful
protection
of
a
very
magnificent
concerto
i
will
honestly
tell
you
of
one
scheme
which
has
lately
come
into
my
head
for
bringing
matters
to
bear
indeed
i
am
bound
to
let
you
into
the
secret
for
you
are
a
party
concerned
i
dare
say
you
have
seen
enough
of
edward
to
know
that
he
would
prefer
the
church
to
every
other
profession
now
my
plan
is
that
he
should
take
orders
as
soon
as
he
can
and
then
through
your
interest
which
i
am
sure
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
use
out
of
friendship
for
him
and
i
hope
out
of
some
regard
to
me
your
brother
might
be
persuaded
to
give
him
norland
living
which
i
understand
is
a
very
good
one
and
the
present
incumbent
not
likely
to
live
a
great
while
that
would
be
enough
for
us
to
marry
upon
and
we
might
trust
to
time
and
chance
for
the
rest
i
should
always
be
happy
replied
elinor
to
show
any
mark
of
my
esteem
and
friendship
for
mr
ferrars
but
do
you
not
perceive
that
my
interest
on
such
an
occasion
would
be
perfectly
unnecessary
he
is
brother
to
mrs
john
dashwood
that
must
be
recommendation
enough
to
her
husband
but
mrs
john
dashwood
would
not
much
approve
of
edward
s
going
into
orders
then
i
rather
suspect
that
my
interest
would
do
very
little
they
were
again
silent
for
many
minutes
at
length
lucy
exclaimed
with
a
deep
sigh
i
believe
it
would
be
the
wisest
way
to
put
an
end
to
the
business
at
once
by
dissolving
the
engagement
we
seem
so
beset
with
difficulties
on
every
side
that
though
it
would
make
us
miserable
for
a
time
we
should
be
happier
perhaps
in
the
end
but
you
will
not
give
me
your
advice
miss
dashwood
no
answered
elinor
with
a
smile
which
concealed
very
agitated
feelings
on
such
a
subject
i
certainly
will
not
you
know
very
well
that
my
opinion
would
have
no
weight
with
you
unless
it
were
on
the
side
of
your
wishes
indeed
you
wrong
me
replied
lucy
with
great
solemnity
i
know
nobody
of
whose
judgment
i
think
so
highly
as
i
do
of
yours
and
i
do
really
believe
that
if
you
was
to
say
to
me
i
advise
you
by
all
means
to
put
an
end
to
your
engagement
with
edward
ferrars
it
will
be
more
for
the
happiness
of
both
of
you
i
should
resolve
upon
doing
it
immediately
elinor
blushed
for
the
insincerity
of
edward
s
future
wife
and
replied
this
compliment
would
effectually
frighten
me
from
giving
any
opinion
on
the
subject
had
i
formed
one
it
raises
my
influence
much
too
high
the
power
of
dividing
two
people
so
tenderly
attached
is
too
much
for
an
indifferent
person
tis
because
you
are
an
indifferent
person
said
lucy
with
some
pique
and
laying
a
particular
stress
on
those
words
that
your
judgment
might
justly
have
such
weight
with
me
if
you
could
be
supposed
to
be
biased
in
any
respect
by
your
own
feelings
your
opinion
would
not
be
worth
having
elinor
thought
it
wisest
to
make
no
answer
to
this
lest
they
might
provoke
each
other
to
an
unsuitable
increase
of
ease
and
unreserve
and
was
even
partly
determined
never
to
mention
the
subject
again
another
pause
therefore
of
many
minutes
duration
succeeded
this
speech
and
lucy
was
still
the
first
to
end
it
shall
you
be
in
town
this
winter
miss
dashwood
said
she
with
all
her
accustomary
complacency
certainly
not
i
am
sorry
for
that
returned
the
other
while
her
eyes
brightened
at
the
information
it
would
have
gave
me
such
pleasure
to
meet
you
there
but
i
dare
say
you
will
go
for
all
that
to
be
sure
your
brother
and
sister
will
ask
you
to
come
to
them
it
will
not
be
in
my
power
to
accept
their
invitation
if
they
do
how
unlucky
that
is
i
had
quite
depended
upon
meeting
you
there
anne
and
me
are
to
go
the
latter
end
of
january
to
some
relations
who
have
been
wanting
us
to
visit
them
these
several
years
but
i
only
go
for
the
sake
of
seeing
edward
he
will
be
there
in
february
otherwise
london
would
have
no
charms
for
me
i
have
not
spirits
for
it
elinor
was
soon
called
to
the
card
table
by
the
conclusion
of
the
first
rubber
and
the
confidential
discourse
of
the
two
ladies
was
therefore
at
an
end
to
which
both
of
them
submitted
without
any
reluctance
for
nothing
had
been
said
on
either
side
to
make
them
dislike
each
other
less
than
they
had
done
before
and
elinor
sat
down
to
the
card
table
with
the
melancholy
persuasion
that
edward
was
not
only
without
affection
for
the
person
who
was
to
be
his
wife
but
that
he
had
not
even
the
chance
of
being
tolerably
happy
in
marriage
which
sincere
affection
on
her
side
would
have
given
for
self
interest
alone
could
induce
a
woman
to
keep
a
man
to
an
engagement
of
which
she
seemed
so
thoroughly
aware
that
he
was
weary
from
this
time
the
subject
was
never
revived
by
elinor
and
when
entered
on
by
lucy
who
seldom
missed
an
opportunity
of
introducing
it
and
was
particularly
careful
to
inform
her
confidante
of
her
happiness
whenever
she
received
a
letter
from
edward
it
was
treated
by
the
former
with
calmness
and
caution
and
dismissed
as
soon
as
civility
would
allow
for
she
felt
such
conversations
to
be
an
indulgence
which
lucy
did
not
deserve
and
which
were
dangerous
to
herself
the
visit
of
the
miss
steeles
at
barton
park
was
lengthened
far
beyond
what
the
first
invitation
implied
their
favour
increased
they
could
not
be
spared
sir
john
would
not
hear
of
their
going
and
in
spite
of
their
numerous
and
long
arranged
engagements
in
exeter
in
spite
of
the
absolute
necessity
of
returning
to
fulfill
them
immediately
which
was
in
full
force
at
the
end
of
every
week
they
were
prevailed
on
to
stay
nearly
two
months
at
the
park
and
to
assist
in
the
due
celebration
of
that
festival
which
requires
a
more
than
ordinary
share
of
private
balls
and
large
dinners
to
proclaim
its
importance
though
mrs
jennings
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
a
large
portion
of
the
year
at
the
houses
of
her
children
and
friends
she
was
not
without
a
settled
habitation
of
her
own
since
the
death
of
her
husband
who
had
traded
with
success
in
a
less
elegant
part
of
the
town
she
had
resided
every
winter
in
a
house
in
one
of
the
streets
near
portman
square
towards
this
home
she
began
on
the
approach
of
january
to
turn
her
thoughts
and
thither
she
one
day
abruptly
and
very
unexpectedly
by
them
asked
the
elder
misses
dashwood
to
accompany
her
elinor
without
observing
the
varying
complexion
of
her
sister
and
the
animated
look
which
spoke
no
indifference
to
the
plan
immediately
gave
a
grateful
but
absolute
denial
for
both
in
which
she
believed
herself
to
be
speaking
their
united
inclinations
the
reason
alleged
was
their
determined
resolution
of
not
leaving
their
mother
at
that
time
of
the
year
mrs
jennings
received
the
refusal
with
some
surprise
and
repeated
her
invitation
immediately
oh
lord
i
am
sure
your
mother
can
spare
you
very
well
and
i
do
beg
you
will
favour
me
with
your
company
for
i
ve
quite
set
my
heart
upon
it
don
t
fancy
that
you
will
be
any
inconvenience
to
me
for
i
shan
t
put
myself
at
all
out
of
my
way
for
you
it
will
only
be
sending
betty
by
the
coach
and
i
hope
i
can
afford
that
we
three
shall
be
able
to
go
very
well
in
my
chaise
and
when
we
are
in
town
if
you
do
not
like
to
go
wherever
i
do
well
and
good
you
may
always
go
with
one
of
my
daughters
i
am
sure
your
mother
will
not
object
to
it
for
i
have
had
such
good
luck
in
getting
my
own
children
off
my
hands
that
she
will
think
me
a
very
fit
person
to
have
the
charge
of
you
and
if
i
don
t
get
one
of
you
at
least
well
married
before
i
have
done
with
you
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
i
shall
speak
a
good
word
for
you
to
all
the
young
men
you
may
depend
upon
it
i
have
a
notion
said
sir
john
that
miss
marianne
would
not
object
to
such
a
scheme
if
her
elder
sister
would
come
into
it
it
is
very
hard
indeed
that
she
should
not
have
a
little
pleasure
because
miss
dashwood
does
not
wish
it
so
i
would
advise
you
two
to
set
off
for
town
when
you
are
tired
of
barton
without
saying
a
word
to
miss
dashwood
about
it
nay
cried
mrs
jennings
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
monstrous
glad
of
miss
marianne
s
company
whether
miss
dashwood
will
go
or
not
only
the
more
the
merrier
say
i
and
i
thought
it
would
be
more
comfortable
for
them
to
be
together
because
if
they
got
tired
of
me
they
might
talk
to
one
another
and
laugh
at
my
old
ways
behind
my
back
but
one
or
the
other
if
not
both
of
them
i
must
have
lord
bless
me
how
do
you
think
i
can
live
poking
by
myself
i
who
have
been
always
used
till
this
winter
to
have
charlotte
with
me
come
miss
marianne
let
us
strike
hands
upon
the
bargain
and
if
miss
dashwood
will
change
her
mind
by
and
bye
why
so
much
the
better
i
thank
you
ma
am
sincerely
thank
you
said
marianne
with
warmth
your
invitation
has
insured
my
gratitude
for
ever
and
it
would
give
me
such
happiness
yes
almost
the
greatest
happiness
i
am
capable
of
to
be
able
to
accept
it
but
my
mother
my
dearest
kindest
mother
i
feel
the
justice
of
what
elinor
has
urged
and
if
she
were
to
be
made
less
happy
less
comfortable
by
our
absence
oh
no
nothing
should
tempt
me
to
leave
her
it
should
not
must
not
be
a
struggle
mrs
jennings
repeated
her
assurance
that
mrs
dashwood
could
spare
them
perfectly
well
and
elinor
who
now
understood
her
sister
and
saw
to
what
indifference
to
almost
every
thing
else
she
was
carried
by
her
eagerness
to
be
with
willoughby
again
made
no
farther
direct
opposition
to
the
plan
and
merely
referred
it
to
her
mother
s
decision
from
whom
however
she
scarcely
expected
to
receive
any
support
in
her
endeavour
to
prevent
a
visit
which
she
could
not
approve
of
for
marianne
and
which
on
her
own
account
she
had
particular
reasons
to
avoid
whatever
marianne
was
desirous
of
her
mother
would
be
eager
to
promote
she
could
not
expect
to
influence
the
latter
to
cautiousness
of
conduct
in
an
affair
respecting
which
she
had
never
been
able
to
inspire
her
with
distrust
and
she
dared
not
explain
the
motive
of
her
own
disinclination
for
going
to
london
that
marianne
fastidious
as
she
was
thoroughly
acquainted
with
mrs
jennings
manners
and
invariably
disgusted
by
them
should
overlook
every
inconvenience
of
that
kind
should
disregard
whatever
must
be
most
wounding
to
her
irritable
feelings
in
her
pursuit
of
one
object
was
such
a
proof
so
strong
so
full
of
the
importance
of
that
object
to
her
as
elinor
in
spite
of
all
that
had
passed
was
not
prepared
to
witness
on
being
informed
of
the
invitation
mrs
dashwood
persuaded
that
such
an
excursion
would
be
productive
of
much
amusement
to
both
her
daughters
and
perceiving
through
all
her
affectionate
attention
to
herself
how
much
the
heart
of
marianne
was
in
it
would
not
hear
of
their
declining
the
offer
upon
her
account
insisted
on
their
both
accepting
it
directly
and
then
began
to
foresee
with
her
usual
cheerfulness
a
variety
of
advantages
that
would
accrue
to
them
all
from
this
separation
i
am
delighted
with
the
plan
she
cried
it
is
exactly
what
i
could
wish
margaret
and
i
shall
be
as
much
benefited
by
it
as
yourselves
when
you
and
the
middletons
are
gone
we
shall
go
on
so
quietly
and
happily
together
with
our
books
and
our
music
you
will
find
margaret
so
improved
when
you
come
back
again
i
have
a
little
plan
of
alteration
for
your
bedrooms
too
which
may
now
be
performed
without
any
inconvenience
to
any
one
it
is
very
right
that
you
should
go
to
town
i
would
have
every
young
woman
of
your
condition
in
life
acquainted
with
the
manners
and
amusements
of
london
you
will
be
under
the
care
of
a
motherly
good
sort
of
woman
of
whose
kindness
to
you
i
can
have
no
doubt
and
in
all
probability
you
will
see
your
brother
and
whatever
may
be
his
faults
or
the
faults
of
his
wife
when
i
consider
whose
son
he
is
i
cannot
bear
to
have
you
so
wholly
estranged
from
each
other
though
with
your
usual
anxiety
for
our
happiness
said
elinor
you
have
been
obviating
every
impediment
to
the
present
scheme
which
occurred
to
you
there
is
still
one
objection
which
in
my
opinion
cannot
be
so
easily
removed
marianne
s
countenance
sunk
and
what
said
mrs
dashwood
is
my
dear
prudent
elinor
going
to
suggest
what
formidable
obstacle
is
she
now
to
bring
forward
do
let
me
hear
a
word
about
the
expense
of
it
my
objection
is
this
though
i
think
very
well
of
mrs
jennings
s
heart
she
is
not
a
woman
whose
society
can
afford
us
pleasure
or
whose
protection
will
give
us
consequence
that
is
very
true
replied
her
mother
but
of
her
society
separately
from
that
of
other
people
you
will
scarcely
have
any
thing
at
all
and
you
will
almost
always
appear
in
public
with
lady
middleton
if
elinor
is
frightened
away
by
her
dislike
of
mrs
jennings
said
marianne
at
least
it
need
not
prevent
my
accepting
her
invitation
i
have
no
such
scruples
and
i
am
sure
i
could
put
up
with
every
unpleasantness
of
that
kind
with
very
little
effort
elinor
could
not
help
smiling
at
this
display
of
indifference
towards
the
manners
of
a
person
to
whom
she
had
often
had
difficulty
in
persuading
marianne
to
behave
with
tolerable
politeness
and
resolved
within
herself
that
if
her
sister
persisted
in
going
she
would
go
likewise
as
she
did
not
think
it
proper
that
marianne
should
be
left
to
the
sole
guidance
of
her
own
judgment
or
that
mrs
jennings
should
be
abandoned
to
the
mercy
of
marianne
for
all
the
comfort
of
her
domestic
hours
to
this
determination
she
was
the
more
easily
reconciled
by
recollecting
that
edward
ferrars
by
lucy
s
account
was
not
to
be
in
town
before
february
and
that
their
visit
without
any
unreasonable
abridgement
might
be
previously
finished
i
will
have
you
both
go
said
mrs
dashwood
these
objections
are
nonsensical
you
will
have
much
pleasure
in
being
in
london
and
especially
in
being
together
and
if
elinor
would
ever
condescend
to
anticipate
enjoyment
she
would
foresee
it
there
from
a
variety
of
sources
she
would
perhaps
expect
some
from
improving
her
acquaintance
with
her
sister
in
law
s
family
elinor
had
often
wished
for
an
opportunity
of
attempting
to
weaken
her
mother
s
dependence
on
the
attachment
of
edward
and
herself
that
the
shock
might
be
less
when
the
whole
truth
were
revealed
and
now
on
this
attack
though
almost
hopeless
of
success
she
forced
herself
to
begin
her
design
by
saying
as
calmly
as
she
could
i
like
edward
ferrars
very
much
and
shall
always
be
glad
to
see
him
but
as
to
the
rest
of
the
family
it
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
whether
i
am
ever
known
to
them
or
not
mrs
dashwood
smiled
and
said
nothing
marianne
lifted
up
her
eyes
in
astonishment
and
elinor
conjectured
that
she
might
as
well
have
held
her
tongue
after
very
little
farther
discourse
it
was
finally
settled
that
the
invitation
should
be
fully
accepted
mrs
jennings
received
the
information
with
a
great
deal
of
joy
and
many
assurances
of
kindness
and
care
nor
was
it
a
matter
of
pleasure
merely
to
her
sir
john
was
delighted
for
to
a
man
whose
prevailing
anxiety
was
the
dread
of
being
alone
the
acquisition
of
two
to
the
number
of
inhabitants
in
london
was
something
even
lady
middleton
took
the
trouble
of
being
delighted
which
was
putting
herself
rather
out
of
her
way
and
as
for
the
miss
steeles
especially
lucy
they
had
never
been
so
happy
in
their
lives
as
this
intelligence
made
them
elinor
submitted
to
the
arrangement
which
counteracted
her
wishes
with
less
reluctance
than
she
had
expected
to
feel
with
regard
to
herself
it
was
now
a
matter
of
unconcern
whether
she
went
to
town
or
not
and
when
she
saw
her
mother
so
thoroughly
pleased
with
the
plan
and
her
sister
exhilarated
by
it
in
look
voice
and
manner
restored
to
all
her
usual
animation
and
elevated
to
more
than
her
usual
gaiety
she
could
not
be
dissatisfied
with
the
cause
and
would
hardly
allow
herself
to
distrust
the
consequence
marianne
s
joy
was
almost
a
degree
beyond
happiness
so
great
was
the
perturbation
of
her
spirits
and
her
impatience
to
be
gone
her
unwillingness
to
quit
her
mother
was
her
only
restorative
to
calmness
and
at
the
moment
of
parting
her
grief
on
that
score
was
excessive
her
mother
s
affliction
was
hardly
less
and
elinor
was
the
only
one
of
the
three
who
seemed
to
consider
the
separation
as
any
thing
short
of
eternal
their
departure
took
place
in
the
first
week
in
january
the
middletons
were
to
follow
in
about
a
week
the
miss
steeles
kept
their
station
at
the
park
and
were
to
quit
it
only
with
the
rest
of
the
family
elinor
could
not
find
herself
in
the
carriage
with
mrs
jennings
and
beginning
a
journey
to
london
under
her
protection
and
as
her
guest
without
wondering
at
her
own
situation
so
short
had
their
acquaintance
with
that
lady
been
so
wholly
unsuited
were
they
in
age
and
disposition
and
so
many
had
been
her
objections
against
such
a
measure
only
a
few
days
before
but
these
objections
had
all
with
that
happy
ardour
of
youth
which
marianne
and
her
mother
equally
shared
been
overcome
or
overlooked
and
elinor
in
spite
of
every
occasional
doubt
of
willoughby
s
constancy
could
not
witness
the
rapture
of
delightful
expectation
which
filled
the
whole
soul
and
beamed
in
the
eyes
of
marianne
without
feeling
how
blank
was
her
own
prospect
how
cheerless
her
own
state
of
mind
in
the
comparison
and
how
gladly
she
would
engage
in
the
solicitude
of
marianne
s
situation
to
have
the
same
animating
object
in
view
the
same
possibility
of
hope
a
short
a
very
short
time
however
must
now
decide
what
willoughby
s
intentions
were
in
all
probability
he
was
already
in
town
marianne
s
eagerness
to
be
gone
declared
her
dependence
on
finding
him
there
and
elinor
was
resolved
not
only
upon
gaining
every
new
light
as
to
his
character
which
her
own
observation
or
the
intelligence
of
others
could
give
her
but
likewise
upon
watching
his
behaviour
to
her
sister
with
such
zealous
attention
as
to
ascertain
what
he
was
and
what
he
meant
before
many
meetings
had
taken
place
should
the
result
of
her
observations
be
unfavourable
she
was
determined
at
all
events
to
open
the
eyes
of
her
sister
should
it
be
otherwise
her
exertions
would
be
of
a
different
nature
she
must
then
learn
to
avoid
every
selfish
comparison
and
banish
every
regret
which
might
lessen
her
satisfaction
in
the
happiness
of
marianne
they
were
three
days
on
their
journey
and
marianne
s
behaviour
as
they
travelled
was
a
happy
specimen
of
what
future
complaisance
and
companionableness
to
mrs
jennings
might
be
expected
to
be
she
sat
in
silence
almost
all
the
way
wrapt
in
her
own
meditations
and
scarcely
ever
voluntarily
speaking
except
when
any
object
of
picturesque
beauty
within
their
view
drew
from
her
an
exclamation
of
delight
exclusively
addressed
to
her
sister
to
atone
for
this
conduct
therefore
elinor
took
immediate
possession
of
the
post
of
civility
which
she
had
assigned
herself
behaved
with
the
greatest
attention
to
mrs
jennings
talked
with
her
laughed
with
her
and
listened
to
her
whenever
she
could
and
mrs
jennings
on
her
side
treated
them
both
with
all
possible
kindness
was
solicitous
on
every
occasion
for
their
ease
and
enjoyment
and
only
disturbed
that
she
could
not
make
them
choose
their
own
dinners
at
the
inn
nor
extort
a
confession
of
their
preferring
salmon
to
cod
or
boiled
fowls
to
veal
cutlets
they
reached
town
by
three
o
clock
the
third
day
glad
to
be
released
after
such
a
journey
from
the
confinement
of
a
carriage
and
ready
to
enjoy
all
the
luxury
of
a
good
fire
the
house
was
handsome
and
handsomely
fitted
up
and
the
young
ladies
were
immediately
put
in
possession
of
a
very
comfortable
apartment
it
had
formerly
been
charlotte
s
and
over
the
mantelpiece
still
hung
a
landscape
in
coloured
silks
of
her
performance
in
proof
of
her
having
spent
seven
years
at
a
great
school
in
town
to
some
effect
as
dinner
was
not
to
be
ready
in
less
than
two
hours
from
their
arrival
elinor
determined
to
employ
the
interval
in
writing
to
her
mother
and
sat
down
for
that
purpose
in
a
few
moments
marianne
did
the
same
i
am
writing
home
marianne
said
elinor
had
not
you
better
defer
your
letter
for
a
day
or
two
i
am
not
going
to
write
to
my
mother
replied
marianne
hastily
and
as
if
wishing
to
avoid
any
farther
inquiry
elinor
said
no
more
it
immediately
struck
her
that
she
must
then
be
writing
to
willoughby
and
the
conclusion
which
as
instantly
followed
was
that
however
mysteriously
they
might
wish
to
conduct
the
affair
they
must
be
engaged
this
conviction
though
not
entirely
satisfactory
gave
her
pleasure
and
she
continued
her
letter
with
greater
alacrity
marianne
s
was
finished
in
a
very
few
minutes
in
length
it
could
be
no
more
than
a
note
it
was
then
folded
up
sealed
and
directed
with
eager
rapidity
elinor
thought
she
could
distinguish
a
large
w
in
the
direction
and
no
sooner
was
it
complete
than
marianne
ringing
the
bell
requested
the
footman
who
answered
it
to
get
that
letter
conveyed
for
her
to
the
two
penny
post
this
decided
the
matter
at
once
her
spirits
still
continued
very
high
but
there
was
a
flutter
in
them
which
prevented
their
giving
much
pleasure
to
her
sister
and
this
agitation
increased
as
the
evening
drew
on
she
could
scarcely
eat
any
dinner
and
when
they
afterwards
returned
to
the
drawing
room
seemed
anxiously
listening
to
the
sound
of
every
carriage
it
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
elinor
that
mrs
jennings
by
being
much
engaged
in
her
own
room
could
see
little
of
what
was
passing
the
tea
things
were
brought
in
and
already
had
marianne
been
disappointed
more
than
once
by
a
rap
at
a
neighbouring
door
when
a
loud
one
was
suddenly
heard
which
could
not
be
mistaken
for
one
at
any
other
house
elinor
felt
secure
of
its
announcing
willoughby
s
approach
and
marianne
starting
up
moved
towards
the
door
every
thing
was
silent
this
could
not
be
borne
many
seconds
she
opened
the
door
advanced
a
few
steps
towards
the
stairs
and
after
listening
half
a
minute
returned
into
the
room
in
all
the
agitation
which
a
conviction
of
having
heard
him
would
naturally
produce
in
the
ecstasy
of
her
feelings
at
that
instant
she
could
not
help
exclaiming
oh
elinor
it
is
willoughby
indeed
it
is
and
seemed
almost
ready
to
throw
herself
into
his
arms
when
colonel
brandon
appeared
it
was
too
great
a
shock
to
be
borne
with
calmness
and
she
immediately
left
the
room
elinor
was
disappointed
too
but
at
the
same
time
her
regard
for
colonel
brandon
ensured
his
welcome
with
her
and
she
felt
particularly
hurt
that
a
man
so
partial
to
her
sister
should
perceive
that
she
experienced
nothing
but
grief
and
disappointment
in
seeing
him
she
instantly
saw
that
it
was
not
unnoticed
by
him
that
he
even
observed
marianne
as
she
quitted
the
room
with
such
astonishment
and
concern
as
hardly
left
him
the
recollection
of
what
civility
demanded
towards
herself
is
your
sister
ill
said
he
elinor
answered
in
some
distress
that
she
was
and
then
talked
of
head
aches
low
spirits
and
over
fatigues
and
of
every
thing
to
which
she
could
decently
attribute
her
sister
s
behaviour
he
heard
her
with
the
most
earnest
attention
but
seeming
to
recollect
himself
said
no
more
on
the
subject
and
began
directly
to
speak
of
his
pleasure
at
seeing
them
in
london
making
the
usual
inquiries
about
their
journey
and
the
friends
they
had
left
behind
in
this
calm
kind
of
way
with
very
little
interest
on
either
side
they
continued
to
talk
both
of
them
out
of
spirits
and
the
thoughts
of
both
engaged
elsewhere
elinor
wished
very
much
to
ask
whether
willoughby
were
then
in
town
but
she
was
afraid
of
giving
him
pain
by
any
enquiry
after
his
rival
and
at
length
by
way
of
saying
something
she
asked
if
he
had
been
in
london
ever
since
she
had
seen
him
last
yes
he
replied
with
some
embarrassment
almost
ever
since
i
have
been
once
or
twice
at
delaford
for
a
few
days
but
it
has
never
been
in
my
power
to
return
to
barton
this
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
said
immediately
brought
back
to
her
remembrance
all
the
circumstances
of
his
quitting
that
place
with
the
uneasiness
and
suspicions
they
had
caused
to
mrs
jennings
and
she
was
fearful
that
her
question
had
implied
much
more
curiosity
on
the
subject
than
she
had
ever
felt
mrs
jennings
soon
came
in
oh
colonel
said
she
with
her
usual
noisy
cheerfulness
i
am
monstrous
glad
to
see
you
sorry
i
could
not
come
before
beg
your
pardon
but
i
have
been
forced
to
look
about
me
a
little
and
settle
my
matters
for
it
is
a
long
while
since
i
have
been
at
home
and
you
know
one
has
always
a
world
of
little
odd
things
to
do
after
one
has
been
away
for
any
time
and
then
i
have
had
cartwright
to
settle
with
lord
i
have
been
as
busy
as
a
bee
ever
since
dinner
but
pray
colonel
how
came
you
to
conjure
out
that
i
should
be
in
town
today
i
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
it
at
mr
palmer
s
where
i
have
been
dining
oh
you
did
well
and
how
do
they
all
do
at
their
house
how
does
charlotte
do
i
warrant
you
she
is
a
fine
size
by
this
time
mrs
palmer
appeared
quite
well
and
i
am
commissioned
to
tell
you
that
you
will
certainly
see
her
to
morrow
ay
to
be
sure
i
thought
as
much
well
colonel
i
have
brought
two
young
ladies
with
me
you
see
that
is
you
see
but
one
of
them
now
but
there
is
another
somewhere
your
friend
miss
marianne
too
which
you
will
not
be
sorry
to
hear
i
do
not
know
what
you
and
mr
willoughby
will
do
between
you
about
her
ay
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
be
young
and
handsome
well
i
was
young
once
but
i
never
was
very
handsome
worse
luck
for
me
however
i
got
a
very
good
husband
and
i
don
t
know
what
the
greatest
beauty
can
do
more
ah
poor
man
he
has
been
dead
these
eight
years
and
better
but
colonel
where
have
you
been
to
since
we
parted
and
how
does
your
business
go
on
come
come
let
s
have
no
secrets
among
friends
he
replied
with
his
accustomary
mildness
to
all
her
inquiries
but
without
satisfying
her
in
any
elinor
now
began
to
make
the
tea
and
marianne
was
obliged
to
appear
again
after
her
entrance
colonel
brandon
became
more
thoughtful
and
silent
than
he
had
been
before
and
mrs
jennings
could
not
prevail
on
him
to
stay
long
no
other
visitor
appeared
that
evening
and
the
ladies
were
unanimous
in
agreeing
to
go
early
to
bed
marianne
rose
the
next
morning
with
recovered
spirits
and
happy
looks
the
disappointment
of
the
evening
before
seemed
forgotten
in
the
expectation
of
what
was
to
happen
that
day
they
had
not
long
finished
their
breakfast
before
mrs
palmer
s
barouche
stopped
at
the
door
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
came
laughing
into
the
room
so
delighted
to
see
them
all
that
it
was
hard
to
say
whether
she
received
most
pleasure
from
meeting
her
mother
or
the
miss
dashwoods
again
so
surprised
at
their
coming
to
town
though
it
was
what
she
had
rather
expected
all
along
so
angry
at
their
accepting
her
mother
s
invitation
after
having
declined
her
own
though
at
the
same
time
she
would
never
have
forgiven
them
if
they
had
not
come
mr
palmer
will
be
so
happy
to
see
you
said
she
what
do
you
think
he
said
when
he
heard
of
your
coming
with
mama
i
forget
what
it
was
now
but
it
was
something
so
droll
after
an
hour
or
two
spent
in
what
her
mother
called
comfortable
chat
or
in
other
words
in
every
variety
of
inquiry
concerning
all
their
acquaintance
on
mrs
jennings
s
side
and
in
laughter
without
cause
on
mrs
palmer
s
it
was
proposed
by
the
latter
that
they
should
all
accompany
her
to
some
shops
where
she
had
business
that
morning
to
which
mrs
jennings
and
elinor
readily
consented
as
having
likewise
some
purchases
to
make
themselves
and
marianne
though
declining
it
at
first
was
induced
to
go
likewise
wherever
they
went
she
was
evidently
always
on
the
watch
in
bond
street
especially
where
much
of
their
business
lay
her
eyes
were
in
constant
inquiry
and
in
whatever
shop
the
party
were
engaged
her
mind
was
equally
abstracted
from
every
thing
actually
before
them
from
all
that
interested
and
occupied
the
others
restless
and
dissatisfied
every
where
her
sister
could
never
obtain
her
opinion
of
any
article
of
purchase
however
it
might
equally
concern
them
both
she
received
no
pleasure
from
anything
was
only
impatient
to
be
at
home
again
and
could
with
difficulty
govern
her
vexation
at
the
tediousness
of
mrs
palmer
whose
eye
was
caught
by
every
thing
pretty
expensive
or
new
who
was
wild
to
buy
all
could
determine
on
none
and
dawdled
away
her
time
in
rapture
and
indecision
it
was
late
in
the
morning
before
they
returned
home
and
no
sooner
had
they
entered
the
house
than
marianne
flew
eagerly
up
stairs
and
when
elinor
followed
she
found
her
turning
from
the
table
with
a
sorrowful
countenance
which
declared
that
no
willoughby
had
been
there
has
no
letter
been
left
here
for
me
since
we
went
out
said
she
to
the
footman
who
then
entered
with
the
parcels
she
was
answered
in
the
negative
are
you
quite
sure
of
it
she
replied
are
you
certain
that
no
servant
no
porter
has
left
any
letter
or
note
the
man
replied
that
none
had
how
very
odd
said
she
in
a
low
and
disappointed
voice
as
she
turned
away
to
the
window
how
odd
indeed
repeated
elinor
within
herself
regarding
her
sister
with
uneasiness
if
she
had
not
known
him
to
be
in
town
she
would
not
have
written
to
him
as
she
did
she
would
have
written
to
combe
magna
and
if
he
is
in
town
how
odd
that
he
should
neither
come
nor
write
oh
my
dear
mother
you
must
be
wrong
in
permitting
an
engagement
between
a
daughter
so
young
a
man
so
little
known
to
be
carried
on
in
so
doubtful
so
mysterious
a
manner
i
long
to
inquire
and
how
will
my
interference
be
borne
she
determined
after
some
consideration
that
if
appearances
continued
many
days
longer
as
unpleasant
as
they
now
were
she
would
represent
in
the
strongest
manner
to
her
mother
the
necessity
of
some
serious
enquiry
into
the
affair
mrs
palmer
and
two
elderly
ladies
of
mrs
jennings
s
intimate
acquaintance
whom
she
had
met
and
invited
in
the
morning
dined
with
them
the
former
left
them
soon
after
tea
to
fulfill
her
evening
engagements
and
elinor
was
obliged
to
assist
in
making
a
whist
table
for
the
others
marianne
was
of
no
use
on
these
occasions
as
she
would
never
learn
the
game
but
though
her
time
was
therefore
at
her
own
disposal
the
evening
was
by
no
means
more
productive
of
pleasure
to
her
than
to
elinor
for
it
was
spent
in
all
the
anxiety
of
expectation
and
the
pain
of
disappointment
she
sometimes
endeavoured
for
a
few
minutes
to
read
but
the
book
was
soon
thrown
aside
and
she
returned
to
the
more
interesting
employment
of
walking
backwards
and
forwards
across
the
room
pausing
for
a
moment
whenever
she
came
to
the
window
in
hopes
of
distinguishing
the
long
expected
rap
if
this
open
weather
holds
much
longer
said
mrs
jennings
when
they
met
at
breakfast
the
following
morning
sir
john
will
not
like
leaving
barton
next
week
tis
a
sad
thing
for
sportsmen
to
lose
a
day
s
pleasure
poor
souls
i
always
pity
them
when
they
do
they
seem
to
take
it
so
much
to
heart
that
is
true
cried
marianne
in
a
cheerful
voice
and
walking
to
the
window
as
she
spoke
to
examine
the
day
i
had
not
thought
of
that
this
weather
will
keep
many
sportsmen
in
the
country
it
was
a
lucky
recollection
all
her
good
spirits
were
restored
by
it
it
is
charming
weather
for
them
indeed
she
continued
as
she
sat
down
to
the
breakfast
table
with
a
happy
countenance
how
much
they
must
enjoy
it
but
with
a
little
return
of
anxiety
it
cannot
be
expected
to
last
long
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
after
such
a
series
of
rain
we
shall
certainly
have
very
little
more
of
it
frosts
will
soon
set
in
and
in
all
probability
with
severity
in
another
day
or
two
perhaps
this
extreme
mildness
can
hardly
last
longer
nay
perhaps
it
may
freeze
tonight
at
any
rate
said
elinor
wishing
to
prevent
mrs
jennings
from
seeing
her
sister
s
thoughts
as
clearly
as
she
did
i
dare
say
we
shall
have
sir
john
and
lady
middleton
in
town
by
the
end
of
next
week
ay
my
dear
i
ll
warrant
you
we
do
mary
always
has
her
own
way
and
now
silently
conjectured
elinor
she
will
write
to
combe
by
this
day
s
post
but
if
she
did
the
letter
was
written
and
sent
away
with
a
privacy
which
eluded
all
her
watchfulness
to
ascertain
the
fact
whatever
the
truth
of
it
might
be
and
far
as
elinor
was
from
feeling
thorough
contentment
about
it
yet
while
she
saw
marianne
in
spirits
she
could
not
be
very
uncomfortable
herself
and
marianne
was
in
spirits
happy
in
the
mildness
of
the
weather
and
still
happier
in
her
expectation
of
a
frost
the
morning
was
chiefly
spent
in
leaving
cards
at
the
houses
of
mrs
jennings
s
acquaintance
to
inform
them
of
her
being
in
town
and
marianne
was
all
the
time
busy
in
observing
the
direction
of
the
wind
watching
the
variations
of
the
sky
and
imagining
an
alteration
in
the
air
don
t
you
find
it
colder
than
it
was
in
the
morning
elinor
there
seems
to
me
a
very
decided
difference
i
can
hardly
keep
my
hands
warm
even
in
my
muff
it
was
not
so
yesterday
i
think
the
clouds
seem
parting
too
the
sun
will
be
out
in
a
moment
and
we
shall
have
a
clear
afternoon
elinor
was
alternately
diverted
and
pained
but
marianne
persevered
and
saw
every
night
in
the
brightness
of
the
fire
and
every
morning
in
the
appearance
of
the
atmosphere
the
certain
symptoms
of
approaching
frost
the
miss
dashwoods
had
no
greater
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
with
mrs
jennings
s
style
of
living
and
set
of
acquaintance
than
with
her
behaviour
to
themselves
which
was
invariably
kind
every
thing
in
her
household
arrangements
was
conducted
on
the
most
liberal
plan
and
excepting
a
few
old
city
friends
whom
to
lady
middleton
s
regret
she
had
never
dropped
she
visited
no
one
to
whom
an
introduction
could
at
all
discompose
the
feelings
of
her
young
companions
pleased
to
find
herself
more
comfortably
situated
in
that
particular
than
she
had
expected
elinor
was
very
willing
to
compound
for
the
want
of
much
real
enjoyment
from
any
of
their
evening
parties
which
whether
at
home
or
abroad
formed
only
for
cards
could
have
little
to
amuse
her
colonel
brandon
who
had
a
general
invitation
to
the
house
was
with
them
almost
every
day
he
came
to
look
at
marianne
and
talk
to
elinor
who
often
derived
more
satisfaction
from
conversing
with
him
than
from
any
other
daily
occurrence
but
who
saw
at
the
same
time
with
much
concern
his
continued
regard
for
her
sister
she
feared
it
was
a
strengthening
regard
it
grieved
her
to
see
the
earnestness
with
which
he
often
watched
marianne
and
his
spirits
were
certainly
worse
than
when
at
barton
about
a
week
after
their
arrival
it
became
certain
that
willoughby
was
also
arrived
his
card
was
on
the
table
when
they
came
in
from
the
morning
s
drive
good
god
cried
marianne
he
has
been
here
while
we
were
out
elinor
rejoiced
to
be
assured
of
his
being
in
london
now
ventured
to
say
depend
upon
it
he
will
call
again
tomorrow
but
marianne
seemed
hardly
to
hear
her
and
on
mrs
jennings
s
entrance
escaped
with
the
precious
card
this
event
while
it
raised
the
spirits
of
elinor
restored
to
those
of
her
sister
all
and
more
than
all
their
former
agitation
from
this
moment
her
mind
was
never
quiet
the
expectation
of
seeing
him
every
hour
of
the
day
made
her
unfit
for
any
thing
she
insisted
on
being
left
behind
the
next
morning
when
the
others
went
out
elinor
s
thoughts
were
full
of
what
might
be
passing
in
berkeley
street
during
their
absence
but
a
moment
s
glance
at
her
sister
when
they
returned
was
enough
to
inform
her
that
willoughby
had
paid
no
second
visit
there
a
note
was
just
then
brought
in
and
laid
on
the
table
for
me
cried
marianne
stepping
hastily
forward
no
ma
am
for
my
mistress
but
marianne
not
convinced
took
it
instantly
up
it
is
indeed
for
mrs
jennings
how
provoking
you
are
expecting
a
letter
then
said
elinor
unable
to
be
longer
silent
yes
a
little
not
much
after
a
short
pause
you
have
no
confidence
in
me
marianne
nay
elinor
this
reproach
from
you
you
who
have
confidence
in
no
one
me
returned
elinor
in
some
confusion
indeed
marianne
i
have
nothing
to
tell
nor
i
answered
marianne
with
energy
our
situations
then
are
alike
we
have
neither
of
us
any
thing
to
tell
you
because
you
do
not
communicate
and
i
because
i
conceal
nothing
elinor
distressed
by
this
charge
of
reserve
in
herself
which
she
was
not
at
liberty
to
do
away
knew
not
how
under
such
circumstances
to
press
for
greater
openness
in
marianne
mrs
jennings
soon
appeared
and
the
note
being
given
her
she
read
it
aloud
it
was
from
lady
middleton
announcing
their
arrival
in
conduit
street
the
night
before
and
requesting
the
company
of
her
mother
and
cousins
the
following
evening
business
on
sir
john
s
part
and
a
violent
cold
on
her
own
prevented
their
calling
in
berkeley
street
the
invitation
was
accepted
but
when
the
hour
of
appointment
drew
near
necessary
as
it
was
in
common
civility
to
mrs
jennings
that
they
should
both
attend
her
on
such
a
visit
elinor
had
some
difficulty
in
persuading
her
sister
to
go
for
still
she
had
seen
nothing
of
willoughby
and
therefore
was
not
more
indisposed
for
amusement
abroad
than
unwilling
to
run
the
risk
of
his
calling
again
in
her
absence
elinor
found
when
the
evening
was
over
that
disposition
is
not
materially
altered
by
a
change
of
abode
for
although
scarcely
settled
in
town
sir
john
had
contrived
to
collect
around
him
nearly
twenty
young
people
and
to
amuse
them
with
a
ball
this
was
an
affair
however
of
which
lady
middleton
did
not
approve
in
the
country
an
unpremeditated
dance
was
very
allowable
but
in
london
where
the
reputation
of
elegance
was
more
important
and
less
easily
attained
it
was
risking
too
much
for
the
gratification
of
a
few
girls
to
have
it
known
that
lady
middleton
had
given
a
small
dance
of
eight
or
nine
couple
with
two
violins
and
a
mere
side
board
collation
mr
and
mrs
palmer
were
of
the
party
from
the
former
whom
they
had
not
seen
before
since
their
arrival
in
town
as
he
was
careful
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
any
attention
to
his
mother
in
law
and
therefore
never
came
near
her
they
received
no
mark
of
recognition
on
their
entrance
he
looked
at
them
slightly
without
seeming
to
know
who
they
were
and
merely
nodded
to
mrs
jennings
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
marianne
gave
one
glance
round
the
apartment
as
she
entered
it
was
enough
he
was
not
there
and
she
sat
down
equally
ill
disposed
to
receive
or
communicate
pleasure
after
they
had
been
assembled
about
an
hour
mr
palmer
sauntered
towards
the
miss
dashwoods
to
express
his
surprise
on
seeing
them
in
town
though
colonel
brandon
had
been
first
informed
of
their
arrival
at
his
house
and
he
had
himself
said
something
very
droll
on
hearing
that
they
were
to
come
i
thought
you
were
both
in
devonshire
said
he
did
you
replied
elinor
when
do
you
go
back
again
i
do
not
know
and
thus
ended
their
discourse
never
had
marianne
been
so
unwilling
to
dance
in
her
life
as
she
was
that
evening
and
never
so
much
fatigued
by
the
exercise
she
complained
of
it
as
they
returned
to
berkeley
street
aye
aye
said
mrs
jennings
we
know
the
reason
of
all
that
very
well
if
a
certain
person
who
shall
be
nameless
had
been
there
you
would
not
have
been
a
bit
tired
and
to
say
the
truth
it
was
not
very
pretty
of
him
not
to
give
you
the
meeting
when
he
was
invited
invited
cried
marianne
so
my
daughter
middleton
told
me
for
it
seems
sir
john
met
him
somewhere
in
the
street
this
morning
marianne
said
no
more
but
looked
exceedingly
hurt
impatient
in
this
situation
to
be
doing
something
that
might
lead
to
her
sister
s
relief
elinor
resolved
to
write
the
next
morning
to
her
mother
and
hoped
by
awakening
her
fears
for
the
health
of
marianne
to
procure
those
inquiries
which
had
been
so
long
delayed
and
she
was
still
more
eagerly
bent
on
this
measure
by
perceiving
after
breakfast
on
the
morrow
that
marianne
was
again
writing
to
willoughby
for
she
could
not
suppose
it
to
be
to
any
other
person
about
the
middle
of
the
day
mrs
jennings
went
out
by
herself
on
business
and
elinor
began
her
letter
directly
while
marianne
too
restless
for
employment
too
anxious
for
conversation
walked
from
one
window
to
the
other
or
sat
down
by
the
fire
in
melancholy
meditation
elinor
was
very
earnest
in
her
application
to
her
mother
relating
all
that
had
passed
her
suspicions
of
willoughby
s
inconstancy
urging
her
by
every
plea
of
duty
and
affection
to
demand
from
marianne
an
account
of
her
real
situation
with
respect
to
him
her
letter
was
scarcely
finished
when
a
rap
foretold
a
visitor
and
colonel
brandon
was
announced
marianne
who
had
seen
him
from
the
window
and
who
hated
company
of
any
kind
left
the
room
before
he
entered
it
he
looked
more
than
usually
grave
and
though
expressing
satisfaction
at
finding
miss
dashwood
alone
as
if
he
had
somewhat
in
particular
to
tell
her
sat
for
some
time
without
saying
a
word
elinor
persuaded
that
he
had
some
communication
to
make
in
which
her
sister
was
concerned
impatiently
expected
its
opening
it
was
not
the
first
time
of
her
feeling
the
same
kind
of
conviction
for
more
than
once
before
beginning
with
the
observation
of
your
sister
looks
unwell
to
day
or
your
sister
seems
out
of
spirits
he
had
appeared
on
the
point
either
of
disclosing
or
of
inquiring
something
particular
about
her
after
a
pause
of
several
minutes
their
silence
was
broken
by
his
asking
her
in
a
voice
of
some
agitation
when
he
was
to
congratulate
her
on
the
acquisition
of
a
brother
elinor
was
not
prepared
for
such
a
question
and
having
no
answer
ready
was
obliged
to
adopt
the
simple
and
common
expedient
of
asking
what
he
meant
he
tried
to
smile
as
he
replied
your
sister
s
engagement
to
mr
willoughby
is
very
generally
known
it
cannot
be
generally
known
returned
elinor
for
her
own
family
do
not
know
it
he
looked
surprised
and
said
i
beg
your
pardon
i
am
afraid
my
inquiry
has
been
impertinent
but
i
had
not
supposed
any
secrecy
intended
as
they
openly
correspond
and
their
marriage
is
universally
talked
of
how
can
that
be
by
whom
can
you
have
heard
it
mentioned
by
many
by
some
of
whom
you
know
nothing
by
others
with
whom
you
are
most
intimate
mrs
jennings
mrs
palmer
and
the
middletons
but
still
i
might
not
have
believed
it
for
where
the
mind
is
perhaps
rather
unwilling
to
be
convinced
it
will
always
find
something
to
support
its
doubts
if
i
had
not
when
the
servant
let
me
in
today
accidentally
seen
a
letter
in
his
hand
directed
to
mr
willoughby
in
your
sister
s
writing
i
came
to
inquire
but
i
was
convinced
before
i
could
ask
the
question
is
every
thing
finally
settled
is
it
impossible
to
but
i
have
no
right
and
i
could
have
no
chance
of
succeeding
excuse
me
miss
dashwood
i
believe
i
have
been
wrong
in
saying
so
much
but
i
hardly
know
what
to
do
and
on
your
prudence
i
have
the
strongest
dependence
tell
me
that
it
is
all
absolutely
resolved
on
that
any
attempt
that
in
short
concealment
if
concealment
be
possible
is
all
that
remains
these
words
which
conveyed
to
elinor
a
direct
avowal
of
his
love
for
her
sister
affected
her
very
much
she
was
not
immediately
able
to
say
anything
and
even
when
her
spirits
were
recovered
she
debated
for
a
short
time
on
the
answer
it
would
be
most
proper
to
give
the
real
state
of
things
between
willoughby
and
her
sister
was
so
little
known
to
herself
that
in
endeavouring
to
explain
it
she
might
be
as
liable
to
say
too
much
as
too
little
yet
as
she
was
convinced
that
marianne
s
affection
for
willoughby
could
leave
no
hope
of
colonel
brandon
s
success
whatever
the
event
of
that
affection
might
be
and
at
the
same
time
wished
to
shield
her
conduct
from
censure
she
thought
it
most
prudent
and
kind
after
some
consideration
to
say
more
than
she
really
knew
or
believed
she
acknowledged
therefore
that
though
she
had
never
been
informed
by
themselves
of
the
terms
on
which
they
stood
with
each
other
of
their
mutual
affection
she
had
no
doubt
and
of
their
correspondence
she
was
not
astonished
to
hear
he
listened
to
her
with
silent
attention
and
on
her
ceasing
to
speak
rose
directly
from
his
seat
and
after
saying
in
a
voice
of
emotion
to
your
sister
i
wish
all
imaginable
happiness
to
willoughby
that
he
may
endeavour
to
deserve
her
took
leave
and
went
away
elinor
derived
no
comfortable
feelings
from
this
conversation
to
lessen
the
uneasiness
of
her
mind
on
other
points
she
was
left
on
the
contrary
with
a
melancholy
impression
of
colonel
brandon
s
unhappiness
and
was
prevented
even
from
wishing
it
removed
by
her
anxiety
for
the
very
event
that
must
confirm
it
nothing
occurred
during
the
next
three
or
four
days
to
make
elinor
regret
what
she
had
done
in
applying
to
her
mother
for
willoughby
neither
came
nor
wrote
they
were
engaged
about
the
end
of
that
time
to
attend
lady
middleton
to
a
party
from
which
mrs
jennings
was
kept
away
by
the
indisposition
of
her
youngest
daughter
and
for
this
party
marianne
wholly
dispirited
careless
of
her
appearance
and
seeming
equally
indifferent
whether
she
went
or
staid
prepared
without
one
look
of
hope
or
one
expression
of
pleasure
she
sat
by
the
drawing
room
fire
after
tea
till
the
moment
of
lady
middleton
s
arrival
without
once
stirring
from
her
seat
or
altering
her
attitude
lost
in
her
own
thoughts
and
insensible
of
her
sister
s
presence
and
when
at
last
they
were
told
that
lady
middleton
waited
for
them
at
the
door
she
started
as
if
she
had
forgotten
that
any
one
was
expected
they
arrived
in
due
time
at
the
place
of
destination
and
as
soon
as
the
string
of
carriages
before
them
would
allow
alighted
ascended
the
stairs
heard
their
names
announced
from
one
landing
place
to
another
in
an
audible
voice
and
entered
a
room
splendidly
lit
up
quite
full
of
company
and
insufferably
hot
when
they
had
paid
their
tribute
of
politeness
by
curtsying
to
the
lady
of
the
house
they
were
permitted
to
mingle
in
the
crowd
and
take
their
share
of
the
heat
and
inconvenience
to
which
their
arrival
must
necessarily
add
after
some
time
spent
in
saying
little
or
doing
less
lady
middleton
sat
down
to
cassino
and
as
marianne
was
not
in
spirits
for
moving
about
she
and
elinor
luckily
succeeding
to
chairs
placed
themselves
at
no
great
distance
from
the
table
they
had
not
remained
in
this
manner
long
before
elinor
perceived
willoughby
standing
within
a
few
yards
of
them
in
earnest
conversation
with
a
very
fashionable
looking
young
woman
she
soon
caught
his
eye
and
he
immediately
bowed
but
without
attempting
to
speak
to
her
or
to
approach
marianne
though
he
could
not
but
see
her
and
then
continued
his
discourse
with
the
same
lady
elinor
turned
involuntarily
to
marianne
to
see
whether
it
could
be
unobserved
by
her
at
that
moment
she
first
perceived
him
and
her
whole
countenance
glowing
with
sudden
delight
she
would
have
moved
towards
him
instantly
had
not
her
sister
caught
hold
of
her
good
heavens
she
exclaimed
he
is
there
he
is
there
oh
why
does
he
not
look
at
me
why
cannot
i
speak
to
him
pray
pray
be
composed
cried
elinor
and
do
not
betray
what
you
feel
to
every
body
present
perhaps
he
has
not
observed
you
yet
this
however
was
more
than
she
could
believe
herself
and
to
be
composed
at
such
a
moment
was
not
only
beyond
the
reach
of
marianne
it
was
beyond
her
wish
she
sat
in
an
agony
of
impatience
which
affected
every
feature
at
last
he
turned
round
again
and
regarded
them
both
she
started
up
and
pronouncing
his
name
in
a
tone
of
affection
held
out
her
hand
to
him
he
approached
and
addressing
himself
rather
to
elinor
than
marianne
as
if
wishing
to
avoid
her
eye
and
determined
not
to
observe
her
attitude
inquired
in
a
hurried
manner
after
mrs
dashwood
and
asked
how
long
they
had
been
in
town
elinor
was
robbed
of
all
presence
of
mind
by
such
an
address
and
was
unable
to
say
a
word
but
the
feelings
of
her
sister
were
instantly
expressed
her
face
was
crimsoned
over
and
she
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
the
greatest
emotion
good
god
willoughby
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
have
you
not
received
my
letters
will
you
not
shake
hands
with
me
he
could
not
then
avoid
it
but
her
touch
seemed
painful
to
him
and
he
held
her
hand
only
for
a
moment
during
all
this
time
he
was
evidently
struggling
for
composure
elinor
watched
his
countenance
and
saw
its
expression
becoming
more
tranquil
after
a
moment
s
pause
he
spoke
with
calmness
i
did
myself
the
honour
of
calling
in
berkeley
street
last
tuesday
and
very
much
regretted
that
i
was
not
fortunate
enough
to
find
yourselves
and
mrs
jennings
at
home
my
card
was
not
lost
i
hope
but
have
you
not
received
my
notes
cried
marianne
in
the
wildest
anxiety
here
is
some
mistake
i
am
sure
some
dreadful
mistake
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
it
tell
me
willoughby
for
heaven
s
sake
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
he
made
no
reply
his
complexion
changed
and
all
his
embarrassment
returned
but
as
if
on
catching
the
eye
of
the
young
lady
with
whom
he
had
been
previously
talking
he
felt
the
necessity
of
instant
exertion
he
recovered
himself
again
and
after
saying
yes
i
had
the
pleasure
of
receiving
the
information
of
your
arrival
in
town
which
you
were
so
good
as
to
send
me
turned
hastily
away
with
a
slight
bow
and
joined
his
friend
marianne
now
looking
dreadfully
white
and
unable
to
stand
sunk
into
her
chair
and
elinor
expecting
every
moment
to
see
her
faint
tried
to
screen
her
from
the
observation
of
others
while
reviving
her
with
lavender
water
go
to
him
elinor
she
cried
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
and
force
him
to
come
to
me
tell
him
i
must
see
him
again
must
speak
to
him
instantly
i
cannot
rest
i
shall
not
have
a
moment
s
peace
till
this
is
explained
some
dreadful
misapprehension
or
other
oh
go
to
him
this
moment
how
can
that
be
done
no
my
dearest
marianne
you
must
wait
this
is
not
the
place
for
explanations
wait
only
till
tomorrow
with
difficulty
however
could
she
prevent
her
from
following
him
herself
and
to
persuade
her
to
check
her
agitation
to
wait
at
least
with
the
appearance
of
composure
till
she
might
speak
to
him
with
more
privacy
and
more
effect
was
impossible
for
marianne
continued
incessantly
to
give
way
in
a
low
voice
to
the
misery
of
her
feelings
by
exclamations
of
wretchedness
in
a
short
time
elinor
saw
willoughby
quit
the
room
by
the
door
towards
the
staircase
and
telling
marianne
that
he
was
gone
urged
the
impossibility
of
speaking
to
him
again
that
evening
as
a
fresh
argument
for
her
to
be
calm
she
instantly
begged
her
sister
would
entreat
lady
middleton
to
take
them
home
as
she
was
too
miserable
to
stay
a
minute
longer
lady
middleton
though
in
the
middle
of
a
rubber
on
being
informed
that
marianne
was
unwell
was
too
polite
to
object
for
a
moment
to
her
wish
of
going
away
and
making
over
her
cards
to
a
friend
they
departed
as
soon
the
carriage
could
be
found
scarcely
a
word
was
spoken
during
their
return
to
berkeley
street
marianne
was
in
a
silent
agony
too
much
oppressed
even
for
tears
but
as
mrs
jennings
was
luckily
not
come
home
they
could
go
directly
to
their
own
room
where
hartshorn
restored
her
a
little
to
herself
she
was
soon
undressed
and
in
bed
and
as
she
seemed
desirous
of
being
alone
her
sister
then
left
her
and
while
she
waited
the
return
of
mrs
jennings
had
leisure
enough
for
thinking
over
the
past
that
some
kind
of
engagement
had
subsisted
between
willoughby
and
marianne
she
could
not
doubt
and
that
willoughby
was
weary
of
it
seemed
equally
clear
for
however
marianne
might
still
feed
her
own
wishes
she
could
not
attribute
such
behaviour
to
mistake
or
misapprehension
of
any
kind
nothing
but
a
thorough
change
of
sentiment
could
account
for
it
her
indignation
would
have
been
still
stronger
than
it
was
had
she
not
witnessed
that
embarrassment
which
seemed
to
speak
a
consciousness
of
his
own
misconduct
and
prevented
her
from
believing
him
so
unprincipled
as
to
have
been
sporting
with
the
affections
of
her
sister
from
the
first
without
any
design
that
would
bear
investigation
absence
might
have
weakened
his
regard
and
convenience
might
have
determined
him
to
overcome
it
but
that
such
a
regard
had
formerly
existed
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
doubt
as
for
marianne
on
the
pangs
which
so
unhappy
a
meeting
must
already
have
given
her
and
on
those
still
more
severe
which
might
await
her
in
its
probable
consequence
she
could
not
reflect
without
the
deepest
concern
her
own
situation
gained
in
the
comparison
for
while
she
could
esteem
edward
as
much
as
ever
however
they
might
be
divided
in
future
her
mind
might
be
always
supported
but
every
circumstance
that
could
embitter
such
an
evil
seemed
uniting
to
heighten
the
misery
of
marianne
in
a
final
separation
from
willoughby
in
an
immediate
and
irreconcilable
rupture
with
him
before
the
house
maid
had
lit
their
fire
the
next
day
or
the
sun
gained
any
power
over
a
cold
gloomy
morning
in
january
marianne
only
half
dressed
was
kneeling
against
one
of
the
window
seats
for
the
sake
of
all
the
little
light
she
could
command
from
it
and
writing
as
fast
as
a
continual
flow
of
tears
would
permit
her
in
this
situation
elinor
roused
from
sleep
by
her
agitation
and
sobs
first
perceived
her
and
after
observing
her
for
a
few
moments
with
silent
anxiety
said
in
a
tone
of
the
most
considerate
gentleness
marianne
may
i
ask
no
elinor
she
replied
ask
nothing
you
will
soon
know
all
the
sort
of
desperate
calmness
with
which
this
was
said
lasted
no
longer
than
while
she
spoke
and
was
immediately
followed
by
a
return
of
the
same
excessive
affliction
it
was
some
minutes
before
she
could
go
on
with
her
letter
and
the
frequent
bursts
of
grief
which
still
obliged
her
at
intervals
to
withhold
her
pen
were
proofs
enough
of
her
feeling
how
more
than
probable
it
was
that
she
was
writing
for
the
last
time
to
willoughby
elinor
paid
her
every
quiet
and
unobtrusive
attention
in
her
power
and
she
would
have
tried
to
sooth
and
tranquilize
her
still
more
had
not
marianne
entreated
her
with
all
the
eagerness
of
the
most
nervous
irritability
not
to
speak
to
her
for
the
world
in
such
circumstances
it
was
better
for
both
that
they
should
not
be
long
together
and
the
restless
state
of
marianne
s
mind
not
only
prevented
her
from
remaining
in
the
room
a
moment
after
she
was
dressed
but
requiring
at
once
solitude
and
continual
change
of
place
made
her
wander
about
the
house
till
breakfast
time
avoiding
the
sight
of
every
body
at
breakfast
she
neither
ate
nor
attempted
to
eat
any
thing
and
elinor
s
attention
was
then
all
employed
not
in
urging
her
not
in
pitying
her
nor
in
appearing
to
regard
her
but
in
endeavouring
to
engage
mrs
jennings
s
notice
entirely
to
herself
as
this
was
a
favourite
meal
with
mrs
jennings
it
lasted
a
considerable
time
and
they
were
just
setting
themselves
after
it
round
the
common
working
table
when
a
letter
was
delivered
to
marianne
which
she
eagerly
caught
from
the
servant
and
turning
of
a
death
like
paleness
instantly
ran
out
of
the
room
elinor
who
saw
as
plainly
by
this
as
if
she
had
seen
the
direction
that
it
must
come
from
willoughby
felt
immediately
such
a
sickness
at
heart
as
made
her
hardly
able
to
hold
up
her
head
and
sat
in
such
a
general
tremour
as
made
her
fear
it
impossible
to
escape
mrs
jennings
s
notice
that
good
lady
however
saw
only
that
marianne
had
received
a
letter
from
willoughby
which
appeared
to
her
a
very
good
joke
and
which
she
treated
accordingly
by
hoping
with
a
laugh
that
she
would
find
it
to
her
liking
of
elinor
s
distress
she
was
too
busily
employed
in
measuring
lengths
of
worsted
for
her
rug
to
see
any
thing
at
all
and
calmly
continuing
her
talk
as
soon
as
marianne
disappeared
she
said
upon
my
word
i
never
saw
a
young
woman
so
desperately
in
love
in
my
life
my
girls
were
nothing
to
her
and
yet
they
used
to
be
foolish
enough
but
as
for
miss
marianne
she
is
quite
an
altered
creature
i
hope
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
he
won
t
keep
her
waiting
much
longer
for
it
is
quite
grievous
to
see
her
look
so
ill
and
forlorn
pray
when
are
they
to
be
married
elinor
though
never
less
disposed
to
speak
than
at
that
moment
obliged
herself
to
answer
such
an
attack
as
this
and
therefore
trying
to
smile
replied
and
have
you
really
ma
am
talked
yourself
into
a
persuasion
of
my
sister
s
being
engaged
to
mr
willoughby
i
thought
it
had
been
only
a
joke
but
so
serious
a
question
seems
to
imply
more
and
i
must
beg
therefore
that
you
will
not
deceive
yourself
any
longer
i
do
assure
you
that
nothing
would
surprise
me
more
than
to
hear
of
their
being
going
to
be
married
for
shame
for
shame
miss
dashwood
how
can
you
talk
so
don
t
we
all
know
that
it
must
be
a
match
that
they
were
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
each
other
from
the
first
moment
they
met
did
not
i
see
them
together
in
devonshire
every
day
and
all
day
long
and
did
not
i
know
that
your
sister
came
to
town
with
me
on
purpose
to
buy
wedding
clothes
come
come
this
won
t
do
because
you
are
so
sly
about
it
yourself
you
think
nobody
else
has
any
senses
but
it
is
no
such
thing
i
can
tell
you
for
it
has
been
known
all
over
town
this
ever
so
long
i
tell
every
body
of
it
and
so
does
charlotte
indeed
ma
am
said
elinor
very
seriously
you
are
mistaken
indeed
you
are
doing
a
very
unkind
thing
in
spreading
the
report
and
you
will
find
that
you
have
though
you
will
not
believe
me
now
mrs
jennings
laughed
again
but
elinor
had
not
spirits
to
say
more
and
eager
at
all
events
to
know
what
willoughby
had
written
hurried
away
to
their
room
where
on
opening
the
door
she
saw
marianne
stretched
on
the
bed
almost
choked
by
grief
one
letter
in
her
hand
and
two
or
three
others
laying
by
her
elinor
drew
near
but
without
saying
a
word
and
seating
herself
on
the
bed
took
her
hand
kissed
her
affectionately
several
times
and
then
gave
way
to
a
burst
of
tears
which
at
first
was
scarcely
less
violent
than
marianne
s
the
latter
though
unable
to
speak
seemed
to
feel
all
the
tenderness
of
this
behaviour
and
after
some
time
thus
spent
in
joint
affliction
she
put
all
the
letters
into
elinor
s
hands
and
then
covering
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
almost
screamed
with
agony
elinor
who
knew
that
such
grief
shocking
as
it
was
to
witness
it
must
have
its
course
watched
by
her
till
this
excess
of
suffering
had
somewhat
spent
itself
and
then
turning
eagerly
to
willoughby
s
letter
read
as
follows
bond
street
january
my
dear
madam
i
have
just
had
the
honour
of
receiving
your
letter
for
which
i
beg
to
return
my
sincere
acknowledgments
i
am
much
concerned
to
find
there
was
anything
in
my
behaviour
last
night
that
did
not
meet
your
approbation
and
though
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
discover
in
what
point
i
could
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
offend
you
i
entreat
your
forgiveness
of
what
i
can
assure
you
to
have
been
perfectly
unintentional
i
shall
never
reflect
on
my
former
acquaintance
with
your
family
in
devonshire
without
the
most
grateful
pleasure
and
flatter
myself
it
will
not
be
broken
by
any
mistake
or
misapprehension
of
my
actions
my
esteem
for
your
whole
family
is
very
sincere
but
if
i
have
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
give
rise
to
a
belief
of
more
than
i
felt
or
meant
to
express
i
shall
reproach
myself
for
not
having
been
more
guarded
in
my
professions
of
that
esteem
that
i
should
ever
have
meant
more
you
will
allow
to
be
impossible
when
you
understand
that
my
affections
have
been
long
engaged
elsewhere
and
it
will
not
be
many
weeks
i
believe
before
this
engagement
is
fulfilled
it
is
with
great
regret
that
i
obey
your
commands
in
returning
the
letters
with
which
i
have
been
honoured
from
you
and
the
lock
of
hair
which
you
so
obligingly
bestowed
on
me
i
am
dear
madam
your
most
obedient
humble
servant
john
willoughby
with
what
indignation
such
a
letter
as
this
must
be
read
by
miss
dashwood
may
be
imagined
though
aware
before
she
began
it
that
it
must
bring
a
confession
of
his
inconstancy
and
confirm
their
separation
for
ever
she
was
not
aware
that
such
language
could
be
suffered
to
announce
it
nor
could
she
have
supposed
willoughby
capable
of
departing
so
far
from
the
appearance
of
every
honourable
and
delicate
feeling
so
far
from
the
common
decorum
of
a
gentleman
as
to
send
a
letter
so
impudently
cruel
a
letter
which
instead
of
bringing
with
his
desire
of
a
release
any
professions
of
regret
acknowledged
no
breach
of
faith
denied
all
peculiar
affection
whatever
a
letter
of
which
every
line
was
an
insult
and
which
proclaimed
its
writer
to
be
deep
in
hardened
villainy
she
paused
over
it
for
some
time
with
indignant
astonishment
then
read
it
again
and
again
but
every
perusal
only
served
to
increase
her
abhorrence
of
the
man
and
so
bitter
were
her
feelings
against
him
that
she
dared
not
trust
herself
to
speak
lest
she
might
wound
marianne
still
deeper
by
treating
their
disengagement
not
as
a
loss
to
her
of
any
possible
good
but
as
an
escape
from
the
worst
and
most
irremediable
of
all
evils
a
connection
for
life
with
an
unprincipled
man
as
a
deliverance
the
most
real
a
blessing
the
most
important
in
her
earnest
meditations
on
the
contents
of
the
letter
on
the
depravity
of
that
mind
which
could
dictate
it
and
probably
on
the
very
different
mind
of
a
very
different
person
who
had
no
other
connection
whatever
with
the
affair
than
what
her
heart
gave
him
with
every
thing
that
passed
elinor
forgot
the
immediate
distress
of
her
sister
forgot
that
she
had
three
letters
on
her
lap
yet
unread
and
so
entirely
forgot
how
long
she
had
been
in
the
room
that
when
on
hearing
a
carriage
drive
up
to
the
door
she
went
to
the
window
to
see
who
could
be
coming
so
unreasonably
early
she
was
all
astonishment
to
perceive
mrs
jennings
s
chariot
which
she
knew
had
not
been
ordered
till
one
determined
not
to
quit
marianne
though
hopeless
of
contributing
at
present
to
her
ease
she
hurried
away
to
excuse
herself
from
attending
mrs
jennings
on
account
of
her
sister
being
indisposed
mrs
jennings
with
a
thoroughly
good
humoured
concern
for
its
cause
admitted
the
excuse
most
readily
and
elinor
after
seeing
her
safe
off
returned
to
marianne
whom
she
found
attempting
to
rise
from
the
bed
and
whom
she
reached
just
in
time
to
prevent
her
from
falling
on
the
floor
faint
and
giddy
from
a
long
want
of
proper
rest
and
food
for
it
was
many
days
since
she
had
any
appetite
and
many
nights
since
she
had
really
slept
and
now
when
her
mind
was
no
longer
supported
by
the
fever
of
suspense
the
consequence
of
all
this
was
felt
in
an
aching
head
a
weakened
stomach
and
a
general
nervous
faintness
a
glass
of
wine
which
elinor
procured
for
her
directly
made
her
more
comfortable
and
she
was
at
last
able
to
express
some
sense
of
her
kindness
by
saying
poor
elinor
how
unhappy
i
make
you
i
only
wish
replied
her
sister
there
were
any
thing
i
could
do
which
might
be
of
comfort
to
you
this
as
every
thing
else
would
have
been
was
too
much
for
marianne
who
could
only
exclaim
in
the
anguish
of
her
heart
oh
elinor
i
am
miserable
indeed
before
her
voice
was
entirely
lost
in
sobs
elinor
could
no
longer
witness
this
torrent
of
unresisted
grief
in
silence
exert
yourself
dear
marianne
she
cried
if
you
would
not
kill
yourself
and
all
who
love
you
think
of
your
mother
think
of
her
misery
while
you
suffer
for
her
sake
you
must
exert
yourself
i
cannot
i
cannot
cried
marianne
leave
me
leave
me
if
i
distress
you
leave
me
hate
me
forget
me
but
do
not
torture
me
so
oh
how
easy
for
those
who
have
no
sorrow
of
their
own
to
talk
of
exertion
happy
happy
elinor
you
cannot
have
an
idea
of
what
i
suffer
do
you
call
me
happy
marianne
ah
if
you
knew
and
can
you
believe
me
to
be
so
while
i
see
you
so
wretched
forgive
me
forgive
me
throwing
her
arms
round
her
sister
s
neck
i
know
you
feel
for
me
i
know
what
a
heart
you
have
but
yet
you
are
you
must
be
happy
edward
loves
you
what
oh
what
can
do
away
such
happiness
as
that
many
many
circumstances
said
elinor
solemnly
no
no
no
cried
marianne
wildly
he
loves
you
and
only
you
you
can
have
no
grief
i
can
have
no
pleasure
while
i
see
you
in
this
state
and
you
will
never
see
me
otherwise
mine
is
a
misery
which
nothing
can
do
away
you
must
not
talk
so
marianne
have
you
no
comforts
no
friends
is
your
loss
such
as
leaves
no
opening
for
consolation
much
as
you
suffer
now
think
of
what
you
would
have
suffered
if
the
discovery
of
his
character
had
been
delayed
to
a
later
period
if
your
engagement
had
been
carried
on
for
months
and
months
as
it
might
have
been
before
he
chose
to
put
an
end
to
it
every
additional
day
of
unhappy
confidence
on
your
side
would
have
made
the
blow
more
dreadful
engagement
cried
marianne
there
has
been
no
engagement
no
engagement
no
he
is
not
so
unworthy
as
you
believe
him
he
has
broken
no
faith
with
me
but
he
told
you
that
he
loved
you
yes
no
never
absolutely
it
was
every
day
implied
but
never
professedly
declared
sometimes
i
thought
it
had
been
but
it
never
was
yet
you
wrote
to
him
yes
could
that
be
wrong
after
all
that
had
passed
but
i
cannot
talk
elinor
said
no
more
and
turning
again
to
the
three
letters
which
now
raised
a
much
stronger
curiosity
than
before
directly
ran
over
the
contents
of
all
the
first
which
was
what
her
sister
had
sent
him
on
their
arrival
in
town
was
to
this
effect
berkeley
street
january
how
surprised
you
will
be
willoughby
on
receiving
this
and
i
think
you
will
feel
something
more
than
surprise
when
you
know
that
i
am
in
town
an
opportunity
of
coming
hither
though
with
mrs
jennings
was
a
temptation
we
could
not
resist
i
wish
you
may
receive
this
in
time
to
come
here
to
night
but
i
will
not
depend
on
it
at
any
rate
i
shall
expect
you
to
morrow
for
the
present
adieu
m
d
her
second
note
which
had
been
written
on
the
morning
after
the
dance
at
the
middletons
was
in
these
words
i
cannot
express
my
disappointment
in
having
missed
you
the
day
before
yesterday
nor
my
astonishment
at
not
having
received
any
answer
to
a
note
which
i
sent
you
above
a
week
ago
i
have
been
expecting
to
hear
from
you
and
still
more
to
see
you
every
hour
of
the
day
pray
call
again
as
soon
as
possible
and
explain
the
reason
of
my
having
expected
this
in
vain
you
had
better
come
earlier
another
time
because
we
are
generally
out
by
one
we
were
last
night
at
lady
middleton
s
where
there
was
a
dance
i
have
been
told
that
you
were
asked
to
be
of
the
party
but
could
it
be
so
you
must
be
very
much
altered
indeed
since
we
parted
if
that
could
be
the
case
and
you
not
there
but
i
will
not
suppose
this
possible
and
i
hope
very
soon
to
receive
your
personal
assurance
of
its
being
otherwise
m
d
the
contents
of
her
last
note
to
him
were
these
what
am
i
to
imagine
willoughby
by
your
behaviour
last
night
again
i
demand
an
explanation
of
it
i
was
prepared
to
meet
you
with
the
pleasure
which
our
separation
naturally
produced
with
the
familiarity
which
our
intimacy
at
barton
appeared
to
me
to
justify
i
was
repulsed
indeed
i
have
passed
a
wretched
night
in
endeavouring
to
excuse
a
conduct
which
can
scarcely
be
called
less
than
insulting
but
though
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
form
any
reasonable
apology
for
your
behaviour
i
am
perfectly
ready
to
hear
your
justification
of
it
you
have
perhaps
been
misinformed
or
purposely
deceived
in
something
concerning
me
which
may
have
lowered
me
in
your
opinion
tell
me
what
it
is
explain
the
grounds
on
which
you
acted
and
i
shall
be
satisfied
in
being
able
to
satisfy
you
it
would
grieve
me
indeed
to
be
obliged
to
think
ill
of
you
but
if
i
am
to
do
it
if
i
am
to
learn
that
you
are
not
what
we
have
hitherto
believed
you
that
your
regard
for
us
all
was
insincere
that
your
behaviour
to
me
was
intended
only
to
deceive
let
it
be
told
as
soon
as
possible
my
feelings
are
at
present
in
a
state
of
dreadful
indecision
i
wish
to
acquit
you
but
certainty
on
either
side
will
be
ease
to
what
i
now
suffer
if
your
sentiments
are
no
longer
what
they
were
you
will
return
my
notes
and
the
lock
of
my
hair
which
is
in
your
possession
m
d
that
such
letters
so
full
of
affection
and
confidence
could
have
been
so
answered
elinor
for
willoughby
s
sake
would
have
been
unwilling
to
believe
but
her
condemnation
of
him
did
not
blind
her
to
the
impropriety
of
their
having
been
written
at
all
and
she
was
silently
grieving
over
the
imprudence
which
had
hazarded
such
unsolicited
proofs
of
tenderness
not
warranted
by
anything
preceding
and
most
severely
condemned
by
the
event
when
marianne
perceiving
that
she
had
finished
the
letters
observed
to
her
that
they
contained
nothing
but
what
any
one
would
have
written
in
the
same
situation
i
felt
myself
she
added
to
be
as
solemnly
engaged
to
him
as
if
the
strictest
legal
covenant
had
bound
us
to
each
other
i
can
believe
it
said
elinor
but
unfortunately
he
did
not
feel
the
same
he
did
feel
the
same
elinor
for
weeks
and
weeks
he
felt
it
i
know
he
did
whatever
may
have
changed
him
now
and
nothing
but
the
blackest
art
employed
against
me
can
have
done
it
i
was
once
as
dear
to
him
as
my
own
soul
could
wish
this
lock
of
hair
which
now
he
can
so
readily
give
up
was
begged
of
me
with
the
most
earnest
supplication
had
you
seen
his
look
his
manner
had
you
heard
his
voice
at
that
moment
have
you
forgot
the
last
evening
of
our
being
together
at
barton
the
morning
that
we
parted
too
when
he
told
me
that
it
might
be
many
weeks
before
we
met
again
his
distress
can
i
ever
forget
his
distress
for
a
moment
or
two
she
could
say
no
more
but
when
this
emotion
had
passed
away
she
added
in
a
firmer
tone
elinor
i
have
been
cruelly
used
but
not
by
willoughby
dearest
marianne
who
but
himself
by
whom
can
he
have
been
instigated
by
all
the
world
rather
than
by
his
own
heart
i
could
rather
believe
every
creature
of
my
acquaintance
leagued
together
to
ruin
me
in
his
opinion
than
believe
his
nature
capable
of
such
cruelty
this
woman
of
whom
he
writes
whoever
she
be
or
any
one
in
short
but
your
own
dear
self
mama
and
edward
may
have
been
so
barbarous
to
bely
me
beyond
you
three
is
there
a
creature
in
the
world
whom
i
would
not
rather
suspect
of
evil
than
willoughby
whose
heart
i
know
so
well
elinor
would
not
contend
and
only
replied
whoever
may
have
been
so
detestably
your
enemy
let
them
be
cheated
of
their
malignant
triumph
my
dear
sister
by
seeing
how
nobly
the
consciousness
of
your
own
innocence
and
good
intentions
supports
your
spirits
it
is
a
reasonable
and
laudable
pride
which
resists
such
malevolence
no
no
cried
marianne
misery
such
as
mine
has
no
pride
i
care
not
who
knows
that
i
am
wretched
the
triumph
of
seeing
me
so
may
be
open
to
all
the
world
elinor
elinor
they
who
suffer
little
may
be
proud
and
independent
as
they
like
may
resist
insult
or
return
mortification
but
i
cannot
i
must
feel
i
must
be
wretched
and
they
are
welcome
to
enjoy
the
consciousness
of
it
that
can
but
for
my
mother
s
sake
and
mine
i
would
do
more
than
for
my
own
but
to
appear
happy
when
i
am
so
miserable
oh
who
can
require
it
again
they
were
both
silent
elinor
was
employed
in
walking
thoughtfully
from
the
fire
to
the
window
from
the
window
to
the
fire
without
knowing
that
she
received
warmth
from
one
or
discerning
objects
through
the
other
and
marianne
seated
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
her
head
leaning
against
one
of
its
posts
again
took
up
willoughby
s
letter
and
after
shuddering
over
every
sentence
exclaimed
it
is
too
much
oh
willoughby
willoughby
could
this
be
yours
cruel
cruel
nothing
can
acquit
you
elinor
nothing
can
whatever
he
might
have
heard
against
me
ought
he
not
to
have
suspended
his
belief
ought
he
not
to
have
told
me
of
it
to
have
given
me
the
power
of
clearing
myself
the
lock
of
hair
repeating
it
from
the
letter
which
you
so
obligingly
bestowed
on
me
that
is
unpardonable
willoughby
where
was
your
heart
when
you
wrote
those
words
oh
barbarously
insolent
elinor
can
he
be
justified
no
marianne
in
no
possible
way
and
yet
this
woman
who
knows
what
her
art
may
have
been
how
long
it
may
have
been
premeditated
and
how
deeply
contrived
by
her
who
is
she
who
can
she
be
whom
did
i
ever
hear
him
talk
of
as
young
and
attractive
among
his
female
acquaintance
oh
no
one
no
one
he
talked
to
me
only
of
myself
another
pause
ensued
marianne
was
greatly
agitated
and
it
ended
thus
elinor
i
must
go
home
i
must
go
and
comfort
mama
can
not
we
be
gone
to
morrow
to
morrow
marianne
yes
why
should
i
stay
here
i
came
only
for
willoughby
s
sake
and
now
who
cares
for
me
who
regards
me
it
would
be
impossible
to
go
to
morrow
we
owe
mrs
jennings
much
more
than
civility
and
civility
of
the
commonest
kind
must
prevent
such
a
hasty
removal
as
that
well
then
another
day
or
two
perhaps
but
i
cannot
stay
here
long
i
cannot
stay
to
endure
the
questions
and
remarks
of
all
these
people
the
middletons
and
palmers
how
am
i
to
bear
their
pity
the
pity
of
such
a
woman
as
lady
middleton
oh
what
would
he
say
to
that
elinor
advised
her
to
lie
down
again
and
for
a
moment
she
did
so
but
no
attitude
could
give
her
ease
and
in
restless
pain
of
mind
and
body
she
moved
from
one
posture
to
another
till
growing
more
and
more
hysterical
her
sister
could
with
difficulty
keep
her
on
the
bed
at
all
and
for
some
time
was
fearful
of
being
constrained
to
call
for
assistance
some
lavender
drops
however
which
she
was
at
length
persuaded
to
take
were
of
use
and
from
that
time
till
mrs
jennings
returned
she
continued
on
the
bed
quiet
and
motionless
mrs
jennings
came
immediately
to
their
room
on
her
return
and
without
waiting
to
have
her
request
of
admittance
answered
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
with
a
look
of
real
concern
how
do
you
do
my
dear
said
she
in
a
voice
of
great
compassion
to
marianne
who
turned
away
her
face
without
attempting
to
answer
how
is
she
miss
dashwood
poor
thing
she
looks
very
bad
no
wonder
ay
it
is
but
too
true
he
is
to
be
married
very
soon
a
good
for
nothing
fellow
i
have
no
patience
with
him
mrs
taylor
told
me
of
it
half
an
hour
ago
and
she
was
told
it
by
a
particular
friend
of
miss
grey
herself
else
i
am
sure
i
should
not
have
believed
it
and
i
was
almost
ready
to
sink
as
it
was
well
said
i
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
this
be
true
he
has
used
a
young
lady
of
my
acquaintance
abominably
ill
and
i
wish
with
all
my
soul
his
wife
may
plague
his
heart
out
and
so
i
shall
always
say
my
dear
you
may
depend
on
it
i
have
no
notion
of
men
s
going
on
in
this
way
and
if
ever
i
meet
him
again
i
will
give
him
such
a
dressing
as
he
has
not
had
this
many
a
day
but
there
is
one
comfort
my
dear
miss
marianne
he
is
not
the
only
young
man
in
the
world
worth
having
and
with
your
pretty
face
you
will
never
want
admirers
well
poor
thing
i
won
t
disturb
her
any
longer
for
she
had
better
have
her
cry
out
at
once
and
have
done
with
the
parrys
and
sandersons
luckily
are
coming
tonight
you
know
and
that
will
amuse
her
she
then
went
away
walking
on
tiptoe
out
of
the
room
as
if
she
supposed
her
young
friend
s
affliction
could
be
increased
by
noise
marianne
to
the
surprise
of
her
sister
determined
on
dining
with
them
elinor
even
advised
her
against
it
but
no
she
would
go
down
she
could
bear
it
very
well
and
the
bustle
about
her
would
be
less
elinor
pleased
to
have
her
governed
for
a
moment
by
such
a
motive
though
believing
it
hardly
possible
that
she
could
sit
out
the
dinner
said
no
more
and
adjusting
her
dress
for
her
as
well
as
she
could
while
marianne
still
remained
on
the
bed
was
ready
to
assist
her
into
the
dining
room
as
soon
as
they
were
summoned
to
it
when
there
though
looking
most
wretchedly
she
ate
more
and
was
calmer
than
her
sister
had
expected
had
she
tried
to
speak
or
had
she
been
conscious
of
half
mrs
jennings
s
well
meant
but
ill
judged
attentions
to
her
this
calmness
could
not
have
been
maintained
but
not
a
syllable
escaped
her
lips
and
the
abstraction
of
her
thoughts
preserved
her
in
ignorance
of
every
thing
that
was
passing
before
her
elinor
who
did
justice
to
mrs
jennings
s
kindness
though
its
effusions
were
often
distressing
and
sometimes
almost
ridiculous
made
her
those
acknowledgments
and
returned
her
those
civilities
which
her
sister
could
not
make
or
return
for
herself
their
good
friend
saw
that
marianne
was
unhappy
and
felt
that
every
thing
was
due
to
her
which
might
make
her
at
all
less
so
she
treated
her
therefore
with
all
the
indulgent
fondness
of
a
parent
towards
a
favourite
child
on
the
last
day
of
its
holidays
marianne
was
to
have
the
best
place
by
the
fire
was
to
be
tempted
to
eat
by
every
delicacy
in
the
house
and
to
be
amused
by
the
relation
of
all
the
news
of
the
day
had
not
elinor
in
the
sad
countenance
of
her
sister
seen
a
check
to
all
mirth
she
could
have
been
entertained
by
mrs
jennings
s
endeavours
to
cure
a
disappointment
in
love
by
a
variety
of
sweetmeats
and
olives
and
a
good
fire
as
soon
however
as
the
consciousness
of
all
this
was
forced
by
continual
repetition
on
marianne
she
could
stay
no
longer
with
a
hasty
exclamation
of
misery
and
a
sign
to
her
sister
not
to
follow
her
she
directly
got
up
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
poor
soul
cried
mrs
jennings
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
how
it
grieves
me
to
see
her
and
i
declare
if
she
is
not
gone
away
without
finishing
her
wine
and
the
dried
cherries
too
lord
nothing
seems
to
do
her
any
good
i
am
sure
if
i
knew
of
any
thing
she
would
like
i
would
send
all
over
the
town
for
it
well
it
is
the
oddest
thing
to
me
that
a
man
should
use
such
a
pretty
girl
so
ill
but
when
there
is
plenty
of
money
on
one
side
and
next
to
none
on
the
other
lord
bless
you
they
care
no
more
about
such
things
the
lady
then
miss
grey
i
think
you
called
her
is
very
rich
fifty
thousand
pounds
my
dear
did
you
ever
see
her
a
smart
stylish
girl
they
say
but
not
handsome
i
remember
her
aunt
very
well
biddy
henshawe
she
married
a
very
wealthy
man
but
the
family
are
all
rich
together
fifty
thousand
pounds
and
by
all
accounts
it
won
t
come
before
it
s
wanted
for
they
say
he
is
all
to
pieces
no
wonder
dashing
about
with
his
curricle
and
hunters
well
it
don
t
signify
talking
but
when
a
young
man
be
who
he
will
comes
and
makes
love
to
a
pretty
girl
and
promises
marriage
he
has
no
business
to
fly
off
from
his
word
only
because
he
grows
poor
and
a
richer
girl
is
ready
to
have
him
why
don
t
he
in
such
a
case
sell
his
horses
let
his
house
turn
off
his
servants
and
make
a
thorough
reform
at
once
i
warrant
you
miss
marianne
would
have
been
ready
to
wait
till
matters
came
round
but
that
won
t
do
now
a
days
nothing
in
the
way
of
pleasure
can
ever
be
given
up
by
the
young
men
of
this
age
do
you
know
what
kind
of
a
girl
miss
grey
is
is
she
said
to
be
amiable
i
never
heard
any
harm
of
her
indeed
i
hardly
ever
heard
her
mentioned
except
that
mrs
taylor
did
say
this
morning
that
one
day
miss
walker
hinted
to
her
that
she
believed
mr
and
mrs
ellison
would
not
be
sorry
to
have
miss
grey
married
for
she
and
mrs
ellison
could
never
agree
and
who
are
the
ellisons
her
guardians
my
dear
but
now
she
is
of
age
and
may
choose
for
herself
and
a
pretty
choice
she
has
made
what
now
after
pausing
a
moment
your
poor
sister
is
gone
to
her
own
room
i
suppose
to
moan
by
herself
is
there
nothing
one
can
get
to
comfort
her
poor
dear
it
seems
quite
cruel
to
let
her
be
alone
well
by
and
by
we
shall
have
a
few
friends
and
that
will
amuse
her
a
little
what
shall
we
play
at
she
hates
whist
i
know
but
is
there
no
round
game
she
cares
for
dear
ma
am
this
kindness
is
quite
unnecessary
marianne
i
dare
say
will
not
leave
her
room
again
this
evening
i
shall
persuade
her
if
i
can
to
go
early
to
bed
for
i
am
sure
she
wants
rest
aye
i
believe
that
will
be
best
for
her
let
her
name
her
own
supper
and
go
to
bed
lord
no
wonder
she
has
been
looking
so
bad
and
so
cast
down
this
last
week
or
two
for
this
matter
i
suppose
has
been
hanging
over
her
head
as
long
as
that
and
so
the
letter
that
came
today
finished
it
poor
soul
i
am
sure
if
i
had
had
a
notion
of
it
i
would
not
have
joked
her
about
it
for
all
my
money
but
then
you
know
how
should
i
guess
such
a
thing
i
made
sure
of
its
being
nothing
but
a
common
love
letter
and
you
know
young
people
like
to
be
laughed
at
about
them
lord
how
concerned
sir
john
and
my
daughters
will
be
when
they
hear
it
if
i
had
my
senses
about
me
i
might
have
called
in
conduit
street
in
my
way
home
and
told
them
of
it
but
i
shall
see
them
tomorrow
it
would
be
unnecessary
i
am
sure
for
you
to
caution
mrs
palmer
and
sir
john
against
ever
naming
mr
willoughby
or
making
the
slightest
allusion
to
what
has
passed
before
my
sister
their
own
good
nature
must
point
out
to
them
the
real
cruelty
of
appearing
to
know
any
thing
about
it
when
she
is
present
and
the
less
that
may
ever
be
said
to
myself
on
the
subject
the
more
my
feelings
will
be
spared
as
you
my
dear
madam
will
easily
believe
oh
lord
yes
that
i
do
indeed
it
must
be
terrible
for
you
to
hear
it
talked
of
and
as
for
your
sister
i
am
sure
i
would
not
mention
a
word
about
it
to
her
for
the
world
you
saw
i
did
not
all
dinner
time
no
more
would
sir
john
nor
my
daughters
for
they
are
all
very
thoughtful
and
considerate
especially
if
i
give
them
a
hint
as
i
certainly
will
for
my
part
i
think
the
less
that
is
said
about
such
things
the
better
the
sooner
tis
blown
over
and
forgot
and
what
does
talking
ever
do
you
know
in
this
affair
it
can
only
do
harm
more
so
perhaps
than
in
many
cases
of
a
similar
kind
for
it
has
been
attended
by
circumstances
which
for
the
sake
of
every
one
concerned
in
it
make
it
unfit
to
become
the
public
conversation
i
must
do
this
justice
to
mr
willoughby
he
has
broken
no
positive
engagement
with
my
sister
law
my
dear
don
t
pretend
to
defend
him
no
positive
engagement
indeed
after
taking
her
all
over
allenham
house
and
fixing
on
the
very
rooms
they
were
to
live
in
hereafter
elinor
for
her
sister
s
sake
could
not
press
the
subject
farther
and
she
hoped
it
was
not
required
of
her
for
willoughby
s
since
though
marianne
might
lose
much
he
could
gain
very
little
by
the
enforcement
of
the
real
truth
after
a
short
silence
on
both
sides
mrs
jennings
with
all
her
natural
hilarity
burst
forth
again
well
my
dear
tis
a
true
saying
about
an
ill
wind
for
it
will
be
all
the
better
for
colonel
brandon
he
will
have
her
at
last
aye
that
he
will
mind
me
now
if
they
an
t
married
by
mid
summer
lord
how
he
ll
chuckle
over
this
news
i
hope
he
will
come
tonight
it
will
be
all
to
one
a
better
match
for
your
sister
two
thousand
a
year
without
debt
or
drawback
except
the
little
love
child
indeed
aye
i
had
forgot
her
but
she
may
be
prenticed
out
at
a
small
cost
and
then
what
does
it
signify
delaford
is
a
nice
place
i
can
tell
you
exactly
what
i
call
a
nice
old
fashioned
place
full
of
comforts
and
conveniences
quite
shut
in
with
great
garden
walls
that
are
covered
with
the
best
fruit
trees
in
the
country
and
such
a
mulberry
tree
in
one
corner
lord
how
charlotte
and
i
did
stuff
the
only
time
we
were
there
then
there
is
a
dove
cote
some
delightful
stew
ponds
and
a
very
pretty
canal
and
every
thing
in
short
that
one
could
wish
for
and
moreover
it
is
close
to
the
church
and
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
turnpike
road
so
tis
never
dull
for
if
you
only
go
and
sit
up
in
an
old
yew
arbour
behind
the
house
you
may
see
all
the
carriages
that
pass
along
oh
tis
a
nice
place
a
butcher
hard
by
in
the
village
and
the
parsonage
house
within
a
stone
s
throw
to
my
fancy
a
thousand
times
prettier
than
barton
park
where
they
are
forced
to
send
three
miles
for
their
meat
and
have
not
a
neighbour
nearer
than
your
mother
well
i
shall
spirit
up
the
colonel
as
soon
as
i
can
one
shoulder
of
mutton
you
know
drives
another
down
if
we
can
but
put
willoughby
out
of
her
head
ay
if
we
can
do
that
ma
am
said
elinor
we
shall
do
very
well
with
or
without
colonel
brandon
and
then
rising
she
went
away
to
join
marianne
whom
she
found
as
she
expected
in
her
own
room
leaning
in
silent
misery
over
the
small
remains
of
a
fire
which
till
elinor
s
entrance
had
been
her
only
light
you
had
better
leave
me
was
all
the
notice
that
her
sister
received
from
her
i
will
leave
you
said
elinor
if
you
will
go
to
bed
but
this
from
the
momentary
perverseness
of
impatient
suffering
she
at
first
refused
to
do
her
sister
s
earnest
though
gentle
persuasion
however
soon
softened
her
to
compliance
and
elinor
saw
her
lay
her
aching
head
on
the
pillow
and
as
she
hoped
in
a
way
to
get
some
quiet
rest
before
she
left
her
in
the
drawing
room
whither
she
then
repaired
she
was
soon
joined
by
mrs
jennings
with
a
wine
glass
full
of
something
in
her
hand
my
dear
said
she
entering
i
have
just
recollected
that
i
have
some
of
the
finest
old
constantia
wine
in
the
house
that
ever
was
tasted
so
i
have
brought
a
glass
of
it
for
your
sister
my
poor
husband
how
fond
he
was
of
it
whenever
he
had
a
touch
of
his
old
colicky
gout
he
said
it
did
him
more
good
than
any
thing
else
in
the
world
do
take
it
to
your
sister
dear
ma
am
replied
elinor
smiling
at
the
difference
of
the
complaints
for
which
it
was
recommended
how
good
you
are
but
i
have
just
left
marianne
in
bed
and
i
hope
almost
asleep
and
as
i
think
nothing
will
be
of
so
much
service
to
her
as
rest
if
you
will
give
me
leave
i
will
drink
the
wine
myself
mrs
jennings
though
regretting
that
she
had
not
been
five
minutes
earlier
was
satisfied
with
the
compromise
and
elinor
as
she
swallowed
the
chief
of
it
reflected
that
though
its
effects
on
a
colicky
gout
were
at
present
of
little
importance
to
her
its
healing
powers
on
a
disappointed
heart
might
be
as
reasonably
tried
on
herself
as
on
her
sister
colonel
brandon
came
in
while
the
party
were
at
tea
and
by
his
manner
of
looking
round
the
room
for
marianne
elinor
immediately
fancied
that
he
neither
expected
nor
wished
to
see
her
there
and
in
short
that
he
was
already
aware
of
what
occasioned
her
absence
mrs
jennings
was
not
struck
by
the
same
thought
for
soon
after
his
entrance
she
walked
across
the
room
to
the
tea
table
where
elinor
presided
and
whispered
the
colonel
looks
as
grave
as
ever
you
see
he
knows
nothing
of
it
do
tell
him
my
dear
he
shortly
afterwards
drew
a
chair
close
to
hers
and
with
a
look
which
perfectly
assured
her
of
his
good
information
inquired
after
her
sister
marianne
is
not
well
said
she
she
has
been
indisposed
all
day
and
we
have
persuaded
her
to
go
to
bed
perhaps
then
he
hesitatingly
replied
what
i
heard
this
morning
may
be
there
may
be
more
truth
in
it
than
i
could
believe
possible
at
first
what
did
you
hear
that
a
gentleman
whom
i
had
reason
to
think
in
short
that
a
man
whom
i
knew
to
be
engaged
but
how
shall
i
tell
you
if
you
know
it
already
as
surely
you
must
i
may
be
spared
you
mean
answered
elinor
with
forced
calmness
mr
willoughby
s
marriage
with
miss
grey
yes
we
do
know
it
all
this
seems
to
have
been
a
day
of
general
elucidation
for
this
very
morning
first
unfolded
it
to
us
mr
willoughby
is
unfathomable
where
did
you
hear
it
in
a
stationer
s
shop
in
pall
mall
where
i
had
business
two
ladies
were
waiting
for
their
carriage
and
one
of
them
was
giving
the
other
an
account
of
the
intended
match
in
a
voice
so
little
attempting
concealment
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
not
to
hear
all
the
name
of
willoughby
john
willoughby
frequently
repeated
first
caught
my
attention
and
what
followed
was
a
positive
assertion
that
every
thing
was
now
finally
settled
respecting
his
marriage
with
miss
grey
it
was
no
longer
to
be
a
secret
it
would
take
place
even
within
a
few
weeks
with
many
particulars
of
preparations
and
other
matters
one
thing
especially
i
remember
because
it
served
to
identify
the
man
still
more
as
soon
as
the
ceremony
was
over
they
were
to
go
to
combe
magna
his
seat
in
somersetshire
my
astonishment
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
what
i
felt
the
communicative
lady
i
learnt
on
inquiry
for
i
stayed
in
the
shop
till
they
were
gone
was
a
mrs
ellison
and
that
as
i
have
been
since
informed
is
the
name
of
miss
grey
s
guardian
it
is
but
have
you
likewise
heard
that
miss
grey
has
fifty
thousand
pounds
in
that
if
in
any
thing
we
may
find
an
explanation
it
may
be
so
but
willoughby
is
capable
at
least
i
think
he
stopped
a
moment
then
added
in
a
voice
which
seemed
to
distrust
itself
and
your
sister
how
did
she
her
sufferings
have
been
very
severe
i
have
only
to
hope
that
they
may
be
proportionately
short
it
has
been
it
is
a
most
cruel
affliction
till
yesterday
i
believe
she
never
doubted
his
regard
and
even
now
perhaps
but
i
am
almost
convinced
that
he
never
was
really
attached
to
her
he
has
been
very
deceitful
and
in
some
points
there
seems
a
hardness
of
heart
about
him
ah
said
colonel
brandon
there
is
indeed
but
your
sister
does
not
i
think
you
said
so
she
does
not
consider
quite
as
you
do
you
know
her
disposition
and
may
believe
how
eagerly
she
would
still
justify
him
if
she
could
he
made
no
answer
and
soon
afterwards
by
the
removal
of
the
tea
things
and
the
arrangement
of
the
card
parties
the
subject
was
necessarily
dropped
mrs
jennings
who
had
watched
them
with
pleasure
while
they
were
talking
and
who
expected
to
see
the
effect
of
miss
dashwood
s
communication
in
such
an
instantaneous
gaiety
on
colonel
brandon
s
side
as
might
have
become
a
man
in
the
bloom
of
youth
of
hope
and
happiness
saw
him
with
amazement
remain
the
whole
evening
more
serious
and
thoughtful
than
usual
from
a
night
of
more
sleep
than
she
had
expected
marianne
awoke
the
next
morning
to
the
same
consciousness
of
misery
in
which
she
had
closed
her
eyes
elinor
encouraged
her
as
much
as
possible
to
talk
of
what
she
felt
and
before
breakfast
was
ready
they
had
gone
through
the
subject
again
and
again
and
with
the
same
steady
conviction
and
affectionate
counsel
on
elinor
s
side
the
same
impetuous
feelings
and
varying
opinions
on
marianne
s
as
before
sometimes
she
could
believe
willoughby
to
be
as
unfortunate
and
as
innocent
as
herself
and
at
others
lost
every
consolation
in
the
impossibility
of
acquitting
him
at
one
moment
she
was
absolutely
indifferent
to
the
observation
of
all
the
world
at
another
she
would
seclude
herself
from
it
for
ever
and
at
a
third
could
resist
it
with
energy
in
one
thing
however
she
was
uniform
when
it
came
to
the
point
in
avoiding
where
it
was
possible
the
presence
of
mrs
jennings
and
in
a
determined
silence
when
obliged
to
endure
it
her
heart
was
hardened
against
the
belief
of
mrs
jennings
s
entering
into
her
sorrows
with
any
compassion
no
no
no
it
cannot
be
she
cried
she
cannot
feel
her
kindness
is
not
sympathy
her
good
nature
is
not
tenderness
all
that
she
wants
is
gossip
and
she
only
likes
me
now
because
i
supply
it
elinor
had
not
needed
this
to
be
assured
of
the
injustice
to
which
her
sister
was
often
led
in
her
opinion
of
others
by
the
irritable
refinement
of
her
own
mind
and
the
too
great
importance
placed
by
her
on
the
delicacies
of
a
strong
sensibility
and
the
graces
of
a
polished
manner
like
half
the
rest
of
the
world
if
more
than
half
there
be
that
are
clever
and
good
marianne
with
excellent
abilities
and
an
excellent
disposition
was
neither
reasonable
nor
candid
she
expected
from
other
people
the
same
opinions
and
feelings
as
her
own
and
she
judged
of
their
motives
by
the
immediate
effect
of
their
actions
on
herself
thus
a
circumstance
occurred
while
the
sisters
were
together
in
their
own
room
after
breakfast
which
sunk
the
heart
of
mrs
jennings
still
lower
in
her
estimation
because
through
her
own
weakness
it
chanced
to
prove
a
source
of
fresh
pain
to
herself
though
mrs
jennings
was
governed
in
it
by
an
impulse
of
the
utmost
goodwill
with
a
letter
in
her
outstretched
hand
and
countenance
gaily
smiling
from
the
persuasion
of
bringing
comfort
she
entered
their
room
saying
now
my
dear
i
bring
you
something
that
i
am
sure
will
do
you
good
marianne
heard
enough
in
one
moment
her
imagination
placed
before
her
a
letter
from
willoughby
full
of
tenderness
and
contrition
explanatory
of
all
that
had
passed
satisfactory
convincing
and
instantly
followed
by
willoughby
himself
rushing
eagerly
into
the
room
to
inforce
at
her
feet
by
the
eloquence
of
his
eyes
the
assurances
of
his
letter
the
work
of
one
moment
was
destroyed
by
the
next
the
hand
writing
of
her
mother
never
till
then
unwelcome
was
before
her
and
in
the
acuteness
of
the
disappointment
which
followed
such
an
ecstasy
of
more
than
hope
she
felt
as
if
till
that
instant
she
had
never
suffered
the
cruelty
of
mrs
jennings
no
language
within
her
reach
in
her
moments
of
happiest
eloquence
could
have
expressed
and
now
she
could
reproach
her
only
by
the
tears
which
streamed
from
her
eyes
with
passionate
violence
a
reproach
however
so
entirely
lost
on
its
object
that
after
many
expressions
of
pity
she
withdrew
still
referring
her
to
the
letter
of
comfort
but
the
letter
when
she
was
calm
enough
to
read
it
brought
little
comfort
willoughby
filled
every
page
her
mother
still
confident
of
their
engagement
and
relying
as
warmly
as
ever
on
his
constancy
had
only
been
roused
by
elinor
s
application
to
intreat
from
marianne
greater
openness
towards
them
both
and
this
with
such
tenderness
towards
her
such
affection
for
willoughby
and
such
a
conviction
of
their
future
happiness
in
each
other
that
she
wept
with
agony
through
the
whole
of
it
all
her
impatience
to
be
at
home
again
now
returned
her
mother
was
dearer
to
her
than
ever
dearer
through
the
very
excess
of
her
mistaken
confidence
in
willoughby
and
she
was
wildly
urgent
to
be
gone
elinor
unable
herself
to
determine
whether
it
were
better
for
marianne
to
be
in
london
or
at
barton
offered
no
counsel
of
her
own
except
of
patience
till
their
mother
s
wishes
could
be
known
and
at
length
she
obtained
her
sister
s
consent
to
wait
for
that
knowledge
mrs
jennings
left
them
earlier
than
usual
for
she
could
not
be
easy
till
the
middletons
and
palmers
were
able
to
grieve
as
much
as
herself
and
positively
refusing
elinor
s
offered
attendance
went
out
alone
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
elinor
with
a
very
heavy
heart
aware
of
the
pain
she
was
going
to
communicate
and
perceiving
by
marianne
s
letter
how
ill
she
had
succeeded
in
laying
any
foundation
for
it
then
sat
down
to
write
her
mother
an
account
of
what
had
passed
and
entreat
her
directions
for
the
future
while
marianne
who
came
into
the
drawing
room
on
mrs
jennings
s
going
away
remained
fixed
at
the
table
where
elinor
wrote
watching
the
advancement
of
her
pen
grieving
over
her
for
the
hardship
of
such
a
task
and
grieving
still
more
fondly
over
its
effect
on
her
mother
in
this
manner
they
had
continued
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
marianne
whose
nerves
could
not
then
bear
any
sudden
noise
was
startled
by
a
rap
at
the
door
who
can
this
be
cried
elinor
so
early
too
i
thought
we
had
been
safe
marianne
moved
to
the
window
it
is
colonel
brandon
said
she
with
vexation
we
are
never
safe
from
him
he
will
not
come
in
as
mrs
jennings
is
from
home
i
will
not
trust
to
that
retreating
to
her
own
room
a
man
who
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
own
time
has
no
conscience
in
his
intrusion
on
that
of
others
the
event
proved
her
conjecture
right
though
it
was
founded
on
injustice
and
error
for
colonel
brandon
did
come
in
and
elinor
who
was
convinced
that
solicitude
for
marianne
brought
him
thither
and
who
saw
that
solicitude
in
his
disturbed
and
melancholy
look
and
in
his
anxious
though
brief
inquiry
after
her
could
not
forgive
her
sister
for
esteeming
him
so
lightly
i
met
mrs
jennings
in
bond
street
said
he
after
the
first
salutation
and
she
encouraged
me
to
come
on
and
i
was
the
more
easily
encouraged
because
i
thought
it
probable
that
i
might
find
you
alone
which
i
was
very
desirous
of
doing
my
object
my
wish
my
sole
wish
in
desiring
it
i
hope
i
believe
it
is
is
to
be
a
means
of
giving
comfort
no
i
must
not
say
comfort
not
present
comfort
but
conviction
lasting
conviction
to
your
sister
s
mind
my
regard
for
her
for
yourself
for
your
mother
will
you
allow
me
to
prove
it
by
relating
some
circumstances
which
nothing
but
a
very
sincere
regard
nothing
but
an
earnest
desire
of
being
useful
i
think
i
am
justified
though
where
so
many
hours
have
been
spent
in
convincing
myself
that
i
am
right
is
there
not
some
reason
to
fear
i
may
be
wrong
he
stopped
i
understand
you
said
elinor
you
have
something
to
tell
me
of
mr
willoughby
that
will
open
his
character
farther
your
telling
it
will
be
the
greatest
act
of
friendship
that
can
be
shewn
marianne
my
gratitude
will
be
insured
immediately
by
any
information
tending
to
that
end
and
hers
must
be
gained
by
it
in
time
pray
pray
let
me
hear
it
you
shall
and
to
be
brief
when
i
quitted
barton
last
october
but
this
will
give
you
no
idea
i
must
go
farther
back
you
will
find
me
a
very
awkward
narrator
miss
dashwood
i
hardly
know
where
to
begin
a
short
account
of
myself
i
believe
will
be
necessary
and
it
shall
be
a
short
one
on
such
a
subject
sighing
heavily
can
i
have
little
temptation
to
be
diffuse
he
stopt
a
moment
for
recollection
and
then
with
another
sigh
went
on
you
have
probably
entirely
forgotten
a
conversation
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
it
could
make
any
impression
on
you
a
conversation
between
us
one
evening
at
barton
park
it
was
the
evening
of
a
dance
in
which
i
alluded
to
a
lady
i
had
once
known
as
resembling
in
some
measure
your
sister
marianne
indeed
answered
elinor
i
have
not
forgotten
it
he
looked
pleased
by
this
remembrance
and
added
if
i
am
not
deceived
by
the
uncertainty
the
partiality
of
tender
recollection
there
is
a
very
strong
resemblance
between
them
as
well
in
mind
as
person
the
same
warmth
of
heart
the
same
eagerness
of
fancy
and
spirits
this
lady
was
one
of
my
nearest
relations
an
orphan
from
her
infancy
and
under
the
guardianship
of
my
father
our
ages
were
nearly
the
same
and
from
our
earliest
years
we
were
playfellows
and
friends
i
cannot
remember
the
time
when
i
did
not
love
eliza
and
my
affection
for
her
as
we
grew
up
was
such
as
perhaps
judging
from
my
present
forlorn
and
cheerless
gravity
you
might
think
me
incapable
of
having
ever
felt
hers
for
me
was
i
believe
fervent
as
the
attachment
of
your
sister
to
mr
willoughby
and
it
was
though
from
a
different
cause
no
less
unfortunate
at
seventeen
she
was
lost
to
me
for
ever
she
was
married
married
against
her
inclination
to
my
brother
her
fortune
was
large
and
our
family
estate
much
encumbered
and
this
i
fear
is
all
that
can
be
said
for
the
conduct
of
one
who
was
at
once
her
uncle
and
guardian
my
brother
did
not
deserve
her
he
did
not
even
love
her
i
had
hoped
that
her
regard
for
me
would
support
her
under
any
difficulty
and
for
some
time
it
did
but
at
last
the
misery
of
her
situation
for
she
experienced
great
unkindness
overcame
all
her
resolution
and
though
she
had
promised
me
that
nothing
but
how
blindly
i
relate
i
have
never
told
you
how
this
was
brought
on
we
were
within
a
few
hours
of
eloping
together
for
scotland
the
treachery
or
the
folly
of
my
cousin
s
maid
betrayed
us
i
was
banished
to
the
house
of
a
relation
far
distant
and
she
was
allowed
no
liberty
no
society
no
amusement
till
my
father
s
point
was
gained
i
had
depended
on
her
fortitude
too
far
and
the
blow
was
a
severe
one
but
had
her
marriage
been
happy
so
young
as
i
then
was
a
few
months
must
have
reconciled
me
to
it
or
at
least
i
should
not
have
now
to
lament
it
this
however
was
not
the
case
my
brother
had
no
regard
for
her
his
pleasures
were
not
what
they
ought
to
have
been
and
from
the
first
he
treated
her
unkindly
the
consequence
of
this
upon
a
mind
so
young
so
lively
so
inexperienced
as
mrs
brandon
s
was
but
too
natural
she
resigned
herself
at
first
to
all
the
misery
of
her
situation
and
happy
had
it
been
if
she
had
not
lived
to
overcome
those
regrets
which
the
remembrance
of
me
occasioned
but
can
we
wonder
that
with
such
a
husband
to
provoke
inconstancy
and
without
a
friend
to
advise
or
restrain
her
for
my
father
lived
only
a
few
months
after
their
marriage
and
i
was
with
my
regiment
in
the
east
indies
she
should
fall
had
i
remained
in
england
perhaps
but
i
meant
to
promote
the
happiness
of
both
by
removing
from
her
for
years
and
for
that
purpose
had
procured
my
exchange
the
shock
which
her
marriage
had
given
me
he
continued
in
a
voice
of
great
agitation
was
of
trifling
weight
was
nothing
to
what
i
felt
when
i
heard
about
two
years
afterwards
of
her
divorce
it
was
that
which
threw
this
gloom
even
now
the
recollection
of
what
i
suffered
he
could
say
no
more
and
rising
hastily
walked
for
a
few
minutes
about
the
room
elinor
affected
by
his
relation
and
still
more
by
his
distress
could
not
speak
he
saw
her
concern
and
coming
to
her
took
her
hand
pressed
it
and
kissed
it
with
grateful
respect
a
few
minutes
more
of
silent
exertion
enabled
him
to
proceed
with
composure
it
was
nearly
three
years
after
this
unhappy
period
before
i
returned
to
england
my
first
care
when
i
did
arrive
was
of
course
to
seek
for
her
but
the
search
was
as
fruitless
as
it
was
melancholy
i
could
not
trace
her
beyond
her
first
seducer
and
there
was
every
reason
to
fear
that
she
had
removed
from
him
only
to
sink
deeper
in
a
life
of
sin
her
legal
allowance
was
not
adequate
to
her
fortune
nor
sufficient
for
her
comfortable
maintenance
and
i
learnt
from
my
brother
that
the
power
of
receiving
it
had
been
made
over
some
months
before
to
another
person
he
imagined
and
calmly
could
he
imagine
it
that
her
extravagance
and
consequent
distress
had
obliged
her
to
dispose
of
it
for
some
immediate
relief
at
last
however
and
after
i
had
been
six
months
in
england
i
did
find
her
regard
for
a
former
servant
of
my
own
who
had
since
fallen
into
misfortune
carried
me
to
visit
him
in
a
spunging
house
where
he
was
confined
for
debt
and
there
in
the
same
house
under
a
similar
confinement
was
my
unfortunate
sister
so
altered
so
faded
worn
down
by
acute
suffering
of
every
kind
hardly
could
i
believe
the
melancholy
and
sickly
figure
before
me
to
be
the
remains
of
the
lovely
blooming
healthful
girl
on
whom
i
had
once
doted
what
i
endured
in
so
beholding
her
but
i
have
no
right
to
wound
your
feelings
by
attempting
to
describe
it
i
have
pained
you
too
much
already
that
she
was
to
all
appearance
in
the
last
stage
of
a
consumption
was
yes
in
such
a
situation
it
was
my
greatest
comfort
life
could
do
nothing
for
her
beyond
giving
time
for
a
better
preparation
for
death
and
that
was
given
i
saw
her
placed
in
comfortable
lodgings
and
under
proper
attendants
i
visited
her
every
day
during
the
rest
of
her
short
life
i
was
with
her
in
her
last
moments
again
he
stopped
to
recover
himself
and
elinor
spoke
her
feelings
in
an
exclamation
of
tender
concern
at
the
fate
of
his
unfortunate
friend
your
sister
i
hope
cannot
be
offended
said
he
by
the
resemblance
i
have
fancied
between
her
and
my
poor
disgraced
relation
their
fates
their
fortunes
cannot
be
the
same
and
had
the
natural
sweet
disposition
of
the
one
been
guarded
by
a
firmer
mind
or
a
happier
marriage
she
might
have
been
all
that
you
will
live
to
see
the
other
be
but
to
what
does
all
this
lead
i
seem
to
have
been
distressing
you
for
nothing
ah
miss
dashwood
a
subject
such
as
this
untouched
for
fourteen
years
it
is
dangerous
to
handle
it
at
all
i
will
be
more
collected
more
concise
she
left
to
my
care
her
only
child
a
little
girl
the
offspring
of
her
first
guilty
connection
who
was
then
about
three
years
old
she
loved
the
child
and
had
always
kept
it
with
her
it
was
a
valued
a
precious
trust
to
me
and
gladly
would
i
have
discharged
it
in
the
strictest
sense
by
watching
over
her
education
myself
had
the
nature
of
our
situations
allowed
it
but
i
had
no
family
no
home
and
my
little
eliza
was
therefore
placed
at
school
i
saw
her
there
whenever
i
could
and
after
the
death
of
my
brother
which
happened
about
five
years
ago
and
which
left
to
me
the
possession
of
the
family
property
she
visited
me
at
delaford
i
called
her
a
distant
relation
but
i
am
well
aware
that
i
have
in
general
been
suspected
of
a
much
nearer
connection
with
her
it
is
now
three
years
ago
she
had
just
reached
her
fourteenth
year
that
i
removed
her
from
school
to
place
her
under
the
care
of
a
very
respectable
woman
residing
in
dorsetshire
who
had
the
charge
of
four
or
five
other
girls
of
about
the
same
time
of
life
and
for
two
years
i
had
every
reason
to
be
pleased
with
her
situation
but
last
february
almost
a
twelvemonth
back
she
suddenly
disappeared
i
had
allowed
her
imprudently
as
it
has
since
turned
out
at
her
earnest
desire
to
go
to
bath
with
one
of
her
young
friends
who
was
attending
her
father
there
for
his
health
i
knew
him
to
be
a
very
good
sort
of
man
and
i
thought
well
of
his
daughter
better
than
she
deserved
for
with
a
most
obstinate
and
ill
judged
secrecy
she
would
tell
nothing
would
give
no
clue
though
she
certainly
knew
all
he
her
father
a
well
meaning
but
not
a
quick
sighted
man
could
really
i
believe
give
no
information
for
he
had
been
generally
confined
to
the
house
while
the
girls
were
ranging
over
the
town
and
making
what
acquaintance
they
chose
and
he
tried
to
convince
me
as
thoroughly
as
he
was
convinced
himself
of
his
daughter
s
being
entirely
unconcerned
in
the
business
in
short
i
could
learn
nothing
but
that
she
was
gone
all
the
rest
for
eight
long
months
was
left
to
conjecture
what
i
thought
what
i
feared
may
be
imagined
and
what
i
suffered
too
good
heavens
cried
elinor
could
it
be
could
willoughby
the
first
news
that
reached
me
of
her
he
continued
came
in
a
letter
from
herself
last
october
it
was
forwarded
to
me
from
delaford
and
i
received
it
on
the
very
morning
of
our
intended
party
to
whitwell
and
this
was
the
reason
of
my
leaving
barton
so
suddenly
which
i
am
sure
must
at
the
time
have
appeared
strange
to
every
body
and
which
i
believe
gave
offence
to
some
little
did
mr
willoughby
imagine
i
suppose
when
his
looks
censured
me
for
incivility
in
breaking
up
the
party
that
i
was
called
away
to
the
relief
of
one
whom
he
had
made
poor
and
miserable
but
had
he
known
it
what
would
it
have
availed
would
he
have
been
less
gay
or
less
happy
in
the
smiles
of
your
sister
no
he
had
already
done
that
which
no
man
who
can
feel
for
another
would
do
he
had
left
the
girl
whose
youth
and
innocence
he
had
seduced
in
a
situation
of
the
utmost
distress
with
no
creditable
home
no
help
no
friends
ignorant
of
his
address
he
had
left
her
promising
to
return
he
neither
returned
nor
wrote
nor
relieved
her
this
is
beyond
every
thing
exclaimed
elinor
his
character
is
now
before
you
expensive
dissipated
and
worse
than
both
knowing
all
this
as
i
have
now
known
it
many
weeks
guess
what
i
must
have
felt
on
seeing
your
sister
as
fond
of
him
as
ever
and
on
being
assured
that
she
was
to
marry
him
guess
what
i
must
have
felt
for
all
your
sakes
when
i
came
to
you
last
week
and
found
you
alone
i
came
determined
to
know
the
truth
though
irresolute
what
to
do
when
it
was
known
my
behaviour
must
have
seemed
strange
to
you
then
but
now
you
will
comprehend
it
to
suffer
you
all
to
be
so
deceived
to
see
your
sister
but
what
could
i
do
i
had
no
hope
of
interfering
with
success
and
sometimes
i
thought
your
sister
s
influence
might
yet
reclaim
him
but
now
after
such
dishonorable
usage
who
can
tell
what
were
his
designs
on
her
whatever
they
may
have
been
however
she
may
now
and
hereafter
doubtless
will
turn
with
gratitude
towards
her
own
condition
when
she
compares
it
with
that
of
my
poor
eliza
when
she
considers
the
wretched
and
hopeless
situation
of
this
poor
girl
and
pictures
her
to
herself
with
an
affection
for
him
so
strong
still
as
strong
as
her
own
and
with
a
mind
tormented
by
self
reproach
which
must
attend
her
through
life
surely
this
comparison
must
have
its
use
with
her
she
will
feel
her
own
sufferings
to
be
nothing
they
proceed
from
no
misconduct
and
can
bring
no
disgrace
on
the
contrary
every
friend
must
be
made
still
more
her
friend
by
them
concern
for
her
unhappiness
and
respect
for
her
fortitude
under
it
must
strengthen
every
attachment
use
your
own
discretion
however
in
communicating
to
her
what
i
have
told
you
you
must
know
best
what
will
be
its
effect
but
had
i
not
seriously
and
from
my
heart
believed
it
might
be
of
service
might
lessen
her
regrets
i
would
not
have
suffered
myself
to
trouble
you
with
this
account
of
my
family
afflictions
with
a
recital
which
may
seem
to
have
been
intended
to
raise
myself
at
the
expense
of
others
elinor
s
thanks
followed
this
speech
with
grateful
earnestness
attended
too
with
the
assurance
of
her
expecting
material
advantage
to
marianne
from
the
communication
of
what
had
passed
i
have
been
more
pained
said
she
by
her
endeavors
to
acquit
him
than
by
all
the
rest
for
it
irritates
her
mind
more
than
the
most
perfect
conviction
of
his
unworthiness
can
do
now
though
at
first
she
will
suffer
much
i
am
sure
she
will
soon
become
easier
have
you
she
continued
after
a
short
silence
ever
seen
mr
willoughby
since
you
left
him
at
barton
yes
he
replied
gravely
once
i
have
one
meeting
was
unavoidable
elinor
startled
by
his
manner
looked
at
him
anxiously
saying
what
have
you
met
him
to
i
could
meet
him
no
other
way
eliza
had
confessed
to
me
though
most
reluctantly
the
name
of
her
lover
and
when
he
returned
to
town
which
was
within
a
fortnight
after
myself
we
met
by
appointment
he
to
defend
i
to
punish
his
conduct
we
returned
unwounded
and
the
meeting
therefore
never
got
abroad
elinor
sighed
over
the
fancied
necessity
of
this
but
to
a
man
and
a
soldier
she
presumed
not
to
censure
it
such
said
colonel
brandon
after
a
pause
has
been
the
unhappy
resemblance
between
the
fate
of
mother
and
daughter
and
so
imperfectly
have
i
discharged
my
trust
is
she
still
in
town
no
as
soon
as
she
recovered
from
her
lying
in
for
i
found
her
near
her
delivery
i
removed
her
and
her
child
into
the
country
and
there
she
remains
recollecting
soon
afterwards
that
he
was
probably
dividing
elinor
from
her
sister
he
put
an
end
to
his
visit
receiving
from
her
again
the
same
grateful
acknowledgments
and
leaving
her
full
of
compassion
and
esteem
for
him
when
the
particulars
of
this
conversation
were
repeated
by
miss
dashwood
to
her
sister
as
they
very
soon
were
the
effect
on
her
was
not
entirely
such
as
the
former
had
hoped
to
see
not
that
marianne
appeared
to
distrust
the
truth
of
any
part
of
it
for
she
listened
to
it
all
with
the
most
steady
and
submissive
attention
made
neither
objection
nor
remark
attempted
no
vindication
of
willoughby
and
seemed
to
shew
by
her
tears
that
she
felt
it
to
be
impossible
but
though
this
behaviour
assured
elinor
that
the
conviction
of
this
guilt
was
carried
home
to
her
mind
though
she
saw
with
satisfaction
the
effect
of
it
in
her
no
longer
avoiding
colonel
brandon
when
he
called
in
her
speaking
to
him
even
voluntarily
speaking
with
a
kind
of
compassionate
respect
and
though
she
saw
her
spirits
less
violently
irritated
than
before
she
did
not
see
her
less
wretched
her
mind
did
become
settled
but
it
was
settled
in
a
gloomy
dejection
she
felt
the
loss
of
willoughby
s
character
yet
more
heavily
than
she
had
felt
the
loss
of
his
heart
his
seduction
and
desertion
of
miss
williams
the
misery
of
that
poor
girl
and
the
doubt
of
what
his
designs
might
once
have
been
on
herself
preyed
altogether
so
much
on
her
spirits
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
speak
of
what
she
felt
even
to
elinor
and
brooding
over
her
sorrows
in
silence
gave
more
pain
to
her
sister
than
could
have
been
communicated
by
the
most
open
and
most
frequent
confession
of
them
to
give
the
feelings
or
the
language
of
mrs
dashwood
on
receiving
and
answering
elinor
s
letter
would
be
only
to
give
a
repetition
of
what
her
daughters
had
already
felt
and
said
of
a
disappointment
hardly
less
painful
than
marianne
s
and
an
indignation
even
greater
than
elinor
s
long
letters
from
her
quickly
succeeding
each
other
arrived
to
tell
all
that
she
suffered
and
thought
to
express
her
anxious
solicitude
for
marianne
and
entreat
she
would
bear
up
with
fortitude
under
this
misfortune
bad
indeed
must
the
nature
of
marianne
s
affliction
be
when
her
mother
could
talk
of
fortitude
mortifying
and
humiliating
must
be
the
origin
of
those
regrets
which
she
could
wish
her
not
to
indulge
against
the
interest
of
her
own
individual
comfort
mrs
dashwood
had
determined
that
it
would
be
better
for
marianne
to
be
any
where
at
that
time
than
at
barton
where
every
thing
within
her
view
would
be
bringing
back
the
past
in
the
strongest
and
most
afflicting
manner
by
constantly
placing
willoughby
before
her
such
as
she
had
always
seen
him
there
she
recommended
it
to
her
daughters
therefore
by
all
means
not
to
shorten
their
visit
to
mrs
jennings
the
length
of
which
though
never
exactly
fixed
had
been
expected
by
all
to
comprise
at
least
five
or
six
weeks
a
variety
of
occupations
of
objects
and
of
company
which
could
not
be
procured
at
barton
would
be
inevitable
there
and
might
yet
she
hoped
cheat
marianne
at
times
into
some
interest
beyond
herself
and
even
into
some
amusement
much
as
the
ideas
of
both
might
now
be
spurned
by
her
from
all
danger
of
seeing
willoughby
again
her
mother
considered
her
to
be
at
least
equally
safe
in
town
as
in
the
country
since
his
acquaintance
must
now
be
dropped
by
all
who
called
themselves
her
friends
design
could
never
bring
them
in
each
other
s
way
negligence
could
never
leave
them
exposed
to
a
surprise
and
chance
had
less
in
its
favour
in
the
crowd
of
london
than
even
in
the
retirement
of
barton
where
it
might
force
him
before
her
while
paying
that
visit
at
allenham
on
his
marriage
which
mrs
dashwood
from
foreseeing
at
first
as
a
probable
event
had
brought
herself
to
expect
as
a
certain
one
she
had
yet
another
reason
for
wishing
her
children
to
remain
where
they
were
a
letter
from
her
son
in
law
had
told
her
that
he
and
his
wife
were
to
be
in
town
before
the
middle
of
february
and
she
judged
it
right
that
they
should
sometimes
see
their
brother
marianne
had
promised
to
be
guided
by
her
mother
s
opinion
and
she
submitted
to
it
therefore
without
opposition
though
it
proved
perfectly
different
from
what
she
wished
and
expected
though
she
felt
it
to
be
entirely
wrong
formed
on
mistaken
grounds
and
that
by
requiring
her
longer
continuance
in
london
it
deprived
her
of
the
only
possible
alleviation
of
her
wretchedness
the
personal
sympathy
of
her
mother
and
doomed
her
to
such
society
and
such
scenes
as
must
prevent
her
ever
knowing
a
moment
s
rest
but
it
was
a
matter
of
great
consolation
to
her
that
what
brought
evil
to
herself
would
bring
good
to
her
sister
and
elinor
on
the
other
hand
suspecting
that
it
would
not
be
in
her
power
to
avoid
edward
entirely
comforted
herself
by
thinking
that
though
their
longer
stay
would
therefore
militate
against
her
own
happiness
it
would
be
better
for
marianne
than
an
immediate
return
into
devonshire
her
carefulness
in
guarding
her
sister
from
ever
hearing
willoughby
s
name
mentioned
was
not
thrown
away
marianne
though
without
knowing
it
herself
reaped
all
its
advantage
for
neither
mrs
jennings
nor
sir
john
nor
even
mrs
palmer
herself
ever
spoke
of
him
before
her
elinor
wished
that
the
same
forbearance
could
have
extended
towards
herself
but
that
was
impossible
and
she
was
obliged
to
listen
day
after
day
to
the
indignation
of
them
all
sir
john
could
not
have
thought
it
possible
a
man
of
whom
he
had
always
had
such
reason
to
think
well
such
a
good
natured
fellow
he
did
not
believe
there
was
a
bolder
rider
in
england
it
was
an
unaccountable
business
he
wished
him
at
the
devil
with
all
his
heart
he
would
not
speak
another
word
to
him
meet
him
where
he
might
for
all
the
world
no
not
if
it
were
to
be
by
the
side
of
barton
covert
and
they
were
kept
watching
for
two
hours
together
such
a
scoundrel
of
a
fellow
such
a
deceitful
dog
it
was
only
the
last
time
they
met
that
he
had
offered
him
one
of
folly
s
puppies
and
this
was
the
end
of
it
mrs
palmer
in
her
way
was
equally
angry
she
was
determined
to
drop
his
acquaintance
immediately
and
she
was
very
thankful
that
she
had
never
been
acquainted
with
him
at
all
she
wished
with
all
her
heart
combe
magna
was
not
so
near
cleveland
but
it
did
not
signify
for
it
was
a
great
deal
too
far
off
to
visit
she
hated
him
so
much
that
she
was
resolved
never
to
mention
his
name
again
and
she
should
tell
everybody
she
saw
how
good
for
nothing
he
was
the
rest
of
mrs
palmer
s
sympathy
was
shewn
in
procuring
all
the
particulars
in
her
power
of
the
approaching
marriage
and
communicating
them
to
elinor
she
could
soon
tell
at
what
coachmaker
s
the
new
carriage
was
building
by
what
painter
mr
willoughby
s
portrait
was
drawn
and
at
what
warehouse
miss
grey
s
clothes
might
be
seen
the
calm
and
polite
unconcern
of
lady
middleton
on
the
occasion
was
a
happy
relief
to
elinor
s
spirits
oppressed
as
they
often
were
by
the
clamorous
kindness
of
the
others
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
her
to
be
sure
of
exciting
no
interest
in
one
person
at
least
among
their
circle
of
friends
a
great
comfort
to
know
that
there
was
one
who
would
meet
her
without
feeling
any
curiosity
after
particulars
or
any
anxiety
for
her
sister
s
health
every
qualification
is
raised
at
times
by
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
to
more
than
its
real
value
and
she
was
sometimes
worried
down
by
officious
condolence
to
rate
good
breeding
as
more
indispensable
to
comfort
than
good
nature
lady
middleton
expressed
her
sense
of
the
affair
about
once
every
day
or
twice
if
the
subject
occurred
very
often
by
saying
it
is
very
shocking
indeed
and
by
the
means
of
this
continual
though
gentle
vent
was
able
not
only
to
see
the
miss
dashwoods
from
the
first
without
the
smallest
emotion
but
very
soon
to
see
them
without
recollecting
a
word
of
the
matter
and
having
thus
supported
the
dignity
of
her
own
sex
and
spoken
her
decided
censure
of
what
was
wrong
in
the
other
she
thought
herself
at
liberty
to
attend
to
the
interest
of
her
own
assemblies
and
therefore
determined
though
rather
against
the
opinion
of
sir
john
that
as
mrs
willoughby
would
at
once
be
a
woman
of
elegance
and
fortune
to
leave
her
card
with
her
as
soon
as
she
married
colonel
brandon
s
delicate
unobtrusive
enquiries
were
never
unwelcome
to
miss
dashwood
he
had
abundantly
earned
the
privilege
of
intimate
discussion
of
her
sister
s
disappointment
by
the
friendly
zeal
with
which
he
had
endeavoured
to
soften
it
and
they
always
conversed
with
confidence
his
chief
reward
for
the
painful
exertion
of
disclosing
past
sorrows
and
present
humiliations
was
given
in
the
pitying
eye
with
which
marianne
sometimes
observed
him
and
the
gentleness
of
her
voice
whenever
though
it
did
not
often
happen
she
was
obliged
or
could
oblige
herself
to
speak
to
him
these
assured
him
that
his
exertion
had
produced
an
increase
of
good
will
towards
himself
and
these
gave
elinor
hopes
of
its
being
farther
augmented
hereafter
but
mrs
jennings
who
knew
nothing
of
all
this
who
knew
only
that
the
colonel
continued
as
grave
as
ever
and
that
she
could
neither
prevail
on
him
to
make
the
offer
himself
nor
commission
her
to
make
it
for
him
began
at
the
end
of
two
days
to
think
that
instead
of
midsummer
they
would
not
be
married
till
michaelmas
and
by
the
end
of
a
week
that
it
would
not
be
a
match
at
all
the
good
understanding
between
the
colonel
and
miss
dashwood
seemed
rather
to
declare
that
the
honours
of
the
mulberry
tree
the
canal
and
the
yew
arbour
would
all
be
made
over
to
her
and
mrs
jennings
had
for
some
time
ceased
to
think
at
all
of
mrs
ferrars
early
in
february
within
a
fortnight
from
the
receipt
of
willoughby
s
letter
elinor
had
the
painful
office
of
informing
her
sister
that
he
was
married
she
had
taken
care
to
have
the
intelligence
conveyed
to
herself
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
the
ceremony
was
over
as
she
was
desirous
that
marianne
should
not
receive
the
first
notice
of
it
from
the
public
papers
which
she
saw
her
eagerly
examining
every
morning
she
received
the
news
with
resolute
composure
made
no
observation
on
it
and
at
first
shed
no
tears
but
after
a
short
time
they
would
burst
out
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
she
was
in
a
state
hardly
less
pitiable
than
when
she
first
learnt
to
expect
the
event
the
willoughbys
left
town
as
soon
as
they
were
married
and
elinor
now
hoped
as
there
could
be
no
danger
of
her
seeing
either
of
them
to
prevail
on
her
sister
who
had
never
yet
left
the
house
since
the
blow
first
fell
to
go
out
again
by
degrees
as
she
had
done
before
about
this
time
the
two
miss
steeles
lately
arrived
at
their
cousin
s
house
in
bartlett
s
buildings
holburn
presented
themselves
again
before
their
more
grand
relations
in
conduit
and
berkeley
streets
and
were
welcomed
by
them
all
with
great
cordiality
elinor
only
was
sorry
to
see
them
their
presence
always
gave
her
pain
and
she
hardly
knew
how
to
make
a
very
gracious
return
to
the
overpowering
delight
of
lucy
in
finding
her
still
in
town
i
should
have
been
quite
disappointed
if
i
had
not
found
you
here
still
said
she
repeatedly
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
word
but
i
always
thought
i
should
i
was
almost
sure
you
would
not
leave
london
yet
awhile
though
you
told
me
you
know
at
barton
that
you
should
not
stay
above
a
month
but
i
thought
at
the
time
that
you
would
most
likely
change
your
mind
when
it
came
to
the
point
it
would
have
been
such
a
great
pity
to
have
went
away
before
your
brother
and
sister
came
and
now
to
be
sure
you
will
be
in
no
hurry
to
be
gone
i
am
amazingly
glad
you
did
not
keep
to
your
word
elinor
perfectly
understood
her
and
was
forced
to
use
all
her
self
command
to
make
it
appear
that
she
did
not
well
my
dear
said
mrs
jennings
and
how
did
you
travel
not
in
the
stage
i
assure
you
replied
miss
steele
with
quick
exultation
we
came
post
all
the
way
and
had
a
very
smart
beau
to
attend
us
dr
davies
was
coming
to
town
and
so
we
thought
we
d
join
him
in
a
post
chaise
and
he
behaved
very
genteelly
and
paid
ten
or
twelve
shillings
more
than
we
did
oh
oh
cried
mrs
jennings
very
pretty
indeed
and
the
doctor
is
a
single
man
i
warrant
you
there
now
said
miss
steele
affectedly
simpering
everybody
laughs
at
me
so
about
the
doctor
and
i
cannot
think
why
my
cousins
say
they
are
sure
i
have
made
a
conquest
but
for
my
part
i
declare
i
never
think
about
him
from
one
hour
s
end
to
another
lord
here
comes
your
beau
nancy
my
cousin
said
t
other
day
when
she
saw
him
crossing
the
street
to
the
house
my
beau
indeed
said
i
i
cannot
think
who
you
mean
the
doctor
is
no
beau
of
mine
aye
aye
that
is
very
pretty
talking
but
it
won
t
do
the
doctor
is
the
man
i
see
no
indeed
replied
her
cousin
with
affected
earnestness
and
i
beg
you
will
contradict
it
if
you
ever
hear
it
talked
of
mrs
jennings
directly
gave
her
the
gratifying
assurance
that
she
certainly
would
not
and
miss
steele
was
made
completely
happy
i
suppose
you
will
go
and
stay
with
your
brother
and
sister
miss
dashwood
when
they
come
to
town
said
lucy
returning
after
a
cessation
of
hostile
hints
to
the
charge
no
i
do
not
think
we
shall
oh
yes
i
dare
say
you
will
elinor
would
not
humour
her
by
farther
opposition
what
a
charming
thing
it
is
that
mrs
dashwood
can
spare
you
both
for
so
long
a
time
together
long
a
time
indeed
interposed
mrs
jennings
why
their
visit
is
but
just
begun
lucy
was
silenced
i
am
sorry
we
cannot
see
your
sister
miss
dashwood
said
miss
steele
i
am
sorry
she
is
not
well
for
marianne
had
left
the
room
on
their
arrival
you
are
very
good
my
sister
will
be
equally
sorry
to
miss
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
but
she
has
been
very
much
plagued
lately
with
nervous
head
aches
which
make
her
unfit
for
company
or
conversation
oh
dear
that
is
a
great
pity
but
such
old
friends
as
lucy
and
me
i
think
she
might
see
us
and
i
am
sure
we
would
not
speak
a
word
elinor
with
great
civility
declined
the
proposal
her
sister
was
perhaps
laid
down
upon
the
bed
or
in
her
dressing
gown
and
therefore
not
able
to
come
to
them
oh
if
that
s
all
cried
miss
steele
we
can
just
as
well
go
and
see
her
elinor
began
to
find
this
impertinence
too
much
for
her
temper
but
she
was
saved
the
trouble
of
checking
it
by
lucy
s
sharp
reprimand
which
now
as
on
many
occasions
though
it
did
not
give
much
sweetness
to
the
manners
of
one
sister
was
of
advantage
in
governing
those
of
the
other
after
some
opposition
marianne
yielded
to
her
sister
s
entreaties
and
consented
to
go
out
with
her
and
mrs
jennings
one
morning
for
half
an
hour
she
expressly
conditioned
however
for
paying
no
visits
and
would
do
no
more
than
accompany
them
to
gray
s
in
sackville
street
where
elinor
was
carrying
on
a
negotiation
for
the
exchange
of
a
few
old
fashioned
jewels
of
her
mother
when
they
stopped
at
the
door
mrs
jennings
recollected
that
there
was
a
lady
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
on
whom
she
ought
to
call
and
as
she
had
no
business
at
gray
s
it
was
resolved
that
while
her
young
friends
transacted
their
s
she
should
pay
her
visit
and
return
for
them
on
ascending
the
stairs
the
miss
dashwoods
found
so
many
people
before
them
in
the
room
that
there
was
not
a
person
at
liberty
to
tend
to
their
orders
and
they
were
obliged
to
wait
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
sit
down
at
that
end
of
the
counter
which
seemed
to
promise
the
quickest
succession
one
gentleman
only
was
standing
there
and
it
is
probable
that
elinor
was
not
without
hope
of
exciting
his
politeness
to
a
quicker
despatch
but
the
correctness
of
his
eye
and
the
delicacy
of
his
taste
proved
to
be
beyond
his
politeness
he
was
giving
orders
for
a
toothpick
case
for
himself
and
till
its
size
shape
and
ornaments
were
determined
all
of
which
after
examining
and
debating
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
over
every
toothpick
case
in
the
shop
were
finally
arranged
by
his
own
inventive
fancy
he
had
no
leisure
to
bestow
any
other
attention
on
the
two
ladies
than
what
was
comprised
in
three
or
four
very
broad
stares
a
kind
of
notice
which
served
to
imprint
on
elinor
the
remembrance
of
a
person
and
face
of
strong
natural
sterling
insignificance
though
adorned
in
the
first
style
of
fashion
marianne
was
spared
from
the
troublesome
feelings
of
contempt
and
resentment
on
this
impertinent
examination
of
their
features
and
on
the
puppyism
of
his
manner
in
deciding
on
all
the
different
horrors
of
the
different
toothpick
cases
presented
to
his
inspection
by
remaining
unconscious
of
it
all
for
she
was
as
well
able
to
collect
her
thoughts
within
herself
and
be
as
ignorant
of
what
was
passing
around
her
in
mr
gray
s
shop
as
in
her
own
bedroom
at
last
the
affair
was
decided
the
ivory
the
gold
and
the
pearls
all
received
their
appointment
and
the
gentleman
having
named
the
last
day
on
which
his
existence
could
be
continued
without
the
possession
of
the
toothpick
case
drew
on
his
gloves
with
leisurely
care
and
bestowing
another
glance
on
the
miss
dashwoods
but
such
a
one
as
seemed
rather
to
demand
than
express
admiration
walked
off
with
a
happy
air
of
real
conceit
and
affected
indifference
elinor
lost
no
time
in
bringing
her
business
forward
was
on
the
point
of
concluding
it
when
another
gentleman
presented
himself
at
her
side
she
turned
her
eyes
towards
his
face
and
found
him
with
some
surprise
to
be
her
brother
their
affection
and
pleasure
in
meeting
was
just
enough
to
make
a
very
creditable
appearance
in
mr
gray
s
shop
john
dashwood
was
really
far
from
being
sorry
to
see
his
sisters
again
it
rather
gave
them
satisfaction
and
his
inquiries
after
their
mother
were
respectful
and
attentive
elinor
found
that
he
and
fanny
had
been
in
town
two
days
i
wished
very
much
to
call
upon
you
yesterday
said
he
but
it
was
impossible
for
we
were
obliged
to
take
harry
to
see
the
wild
beasts
at
exeter
exchange
and
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
with
mrs
ferrars
harry
was
vastly
pleased
this
morning
i
had
fully
intended
to
call
on
you
if
i
could
possibly
find
a
spare
half
hour
but
one
has
always
so
much
to
do
on
first
coming
to
town
i
am
come
here
to
bespeak
fanny
a
seal
but
tomorrow
i
think
i
shall
certainly
be
able
to
call
in
berkeley
street
and
be
introduced
to
your
friend
mrs
jennings
i
understand
she
is
a
woman
of
very
good
fortune
and
the
middletons
too
you
must
introduce
me
to
them
as
my
mother
in
law
s
relations
i
shall
be
happy
to
show
them
every
respect
they
are
excellent
neighbours
to
you
in
the
country
i
understand
excellent
indeed
their
attention
to
our
comfort
their
friendliness
in
every
particular
is
more
than
i
can
express
i
am
extremely
glad
to
hear
it
upon
my
word
extremely
glad
indeed
but
so
it
ought
to
be
they
are
people
of
large
fortune
they
are
related
to
you
and
every
civility
and
accommodation
that
can
serve
to
make
your
situation
pleasant
might
be
reasonably
expected
and
so
you
are
most
comfortably
settled
in
your
little
cottage
and
want
for
nothing
edward
brought
us
a
most
charming
account
of
the
place
the
most
complete
thing
of
its
kind
he
said
that
ever
was
and
you
all
seemed
to
enjoy
it
beyond
any
thing
it
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
us
to
hear
it
i
assure
you
elinor
did
feel
a
little
ashamed
of
her
brother
and
was
not
sorry
to
be
spared
the
necessity
of
answering
him
by
the
arrival
of
mrs
jennings
s
servant
who
came
to
tell
her
that
his
mistress
waited
for
them
at
the
door
mr
dashwood
attended
them
down
stairs
was
introduced
to
mrs
jennings
at
the
door
of
her
carriage
and
repeating
his
hope
of
being
able
to
call
on
them
the
next
day
took
leave
his
visit
was
duly
paid
he
came
with
a
pretence
at
an
apology
from
their
sister
in
law
for
not
coming
too
but
she
was
so
much
engaged
with
her
mother
that
really
she
had
no
leisure
for
going
any
where
mrs
jennings
however
assured
him
directly
that
she
should
not
stand
upon
ceremony
for
they
were
all
cousins
or
something
like
it
and
she
should
certainly
wait
on
mrs
john
dashwood
very
soon
and
bring
her
sisters
to
see
her
his
manners
to
them
though
calm
were
perfectly
kind
to
mrs
jennings
most
attentively
civil
and
on
colonel
brandon
s
coming
in
soon
after
himself
he
eyed
him
with
a
curiosity
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
only
wanted
to
know
him
to
be
rich
to
be
equally
civil
to
him
after
staying
with
them
half
an
hour
he
asked
elinor
to
walk
with
him
to
conduit
street
and
introduce
him
to
sir
john
and
lady
middleton
the
weather
was
remarkably
fine
and
she
readily
consented
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
house
his
enquiries
began
who
is
colonel
brandon
is
he
a
man
of
fortune
yes
he
has
very
good
property
in
dorsetshire
i
am
glad
of
it
he
seems
a
most
gentlemanlike
man
and
i
think
elinor
i
may
congratulate
you
on
the
prospect
of
a
very
respectable
establishment
in
life
me
brother
what
do
you
mean
he
likes
you
i
observed
him
narrowly
and
am
convinced
of
it
what
is
the
amount
of
his
fortune
i
believe
about
two
thousand
a
year
two
thousand
a
year
and
then
working
himself
up
to
a
pitch
of
enthusiastic
generosity
he
added
elinor
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
it
were
twice
as
much
for
your
sake
indeed
i
believe
you
replied
elinor
but
i
am
very
sure
that
colonel
brandon
has
not
the
smallest
wish
of
marrying
me
you
are
mistaken
elinor
you
are
very
much
mistaken
a
very
little
trouble
on
your
side
secures
him
perhaps
just
at
present
he
may
be
undecided
the
smallness
of
your
fortune
may
make
him
hang
back
his
friends
may
all
advise
him
against
it
but
some
of
those
little
attentions
and
encouragements
which
ladies
can
so
easily
give
will
fix
him
in
spite
of
himself
and
there
can
be
no
reason
why
you
should
not
try
for
him
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
any
prior
attachment
on
your
side
in
short
you
know
as
to
an
attachment
of
that
kind
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
the
objections
are
insurmountable
you
have
too
much
sense
not
to
see
all
that
colonel
brandon
must
be
the
man
and
no
civility
shall
be
wanting
on
my
part
to
make
him
pleased
with
you
and
your
family
it
is
a
match
that
must
give
universal
satisfaction
in
short
it
is
a
kind
of
thing
that
lowering
his
voice
to
an
important
whisper
will
be
exceedingly
welcome
to
all
parties
recollecting
himself
however
he
added
that
is
i
mean
to
say
your
friends
are
all
truly
anxious
to
see
you
well
settled
fanny
particularly
for
she
has
your
interest
very
much
at
heart
i
assure
you
and
her
mother
too
mrs
ferrars
a
very
good
natured
woman
i
am
sure
it
would
give
her
great
pleasure
she
said
as
much
the
other
day
elinor
would
not
vouchsafe
any
answer
it
would
be
something
remarkable
now
he
continued
something
droll
if
fanny
should
have
a
brother
and
i
a
sister
settling
at
the
same
time
and
yet
it
is
not
very
unlikely
is
mr
edward
ferrars
said
elinor
with
resolution
going
to
be
married
it
is
not
actually
settled
but
there
is
such
a
thing
in
agitation
he
has
a
most
excellent
mother
mrs
ferrars
with
the
utmost
liberality
will
come
forward
and
settle
on
him
a
thousand
a
year
if
the
match
takes
place
the
lady
is
the
hon
miss
morton
only
daughter
of
the
late
lord
morton
with
thirty
thousand
pounds
a
very
desirable
connection
on
both
sides
and
i
have
not
a
doubt
of
its
taking
place
in
time
a
thousand
a
year
is
a
great
deal
for
a
mother
to
give
away
to
make
over
for
ever
but
mrs
ferrars
has
a
noble
spirit
to
give
you
another
instance
of
her
liberality
the
other
day
as
soon
as
we
came
to
town
aware
that
money
could
not
be
very
plenty
with
us
just
now
she
put
bank
notes
into
fanny
s
hands
to
the
amount
of
two
hundred
pounds
and
extremely
acceptable
it
is
for
we
must
live
at
a
great
expense
while
we
are
here
he
paused
for
her
assent
and
compassion
and
she
forced
herself
to
say
your
expenses
both
in
town
and
country
must
certainly
be
considerable
but
your
income
is
a
large
one
not
so
large
i
dare
say
as
many
people
suppose
i
do
not
mean
to
complain
however
it
is
undoubtedly
a
comfortable
one
and
i
hope
will
in
time
be
better
the
enclosure
of
norland
common
now
carrying
on
is
a
most
serious
drain
and
then
i
have
made
a
little
purchase
within
this
half
year
east
kingham
farm
you
must
remember
the
place
where
old
gibson
used
to
live
the
land
was
so
very
desirable
for
me
in
every
respect
so
immediately
adjoining
my
own
property
that
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
buy
it
i
could
not
have
answered
it
to
my
conscience
to
let
it
fall
into
any
other
hands
a
man
must
pay
for
his
convenience
and
it
has
cost
me
a
vast
deal
of
money
more
than
you
think
it
really
and
intrinsically
worth
why
i
hope
not
that
i
might
have
sold
it
again
the
next
day
for
more
than
i
gave
but
with
regard
to
the
purchase
money
i
might
have
been
very
unfortunate
indeed
for
the
stocks
were
at
that
time
so
low
that
if
i
had
not
happened
to
have
the
necessary
sum
in
my
banker
s
hands
i
must
have
sold
out
to
very
great
loss
elinor
could
only
smile
other
great
and
inevitable
expenses
too
we
have
had
on
first
coming
to
norland
our
respected
father
as
you
well
know
bequeathed
all
the
stanhill
effects
that
remained
at
norland
and
very
valuable
they
were
to
your
mother
far
be
it
from
me
to
repine
at
his
doing
so
he
had
an
undoubted
right
to
dispose
of
his
own
property
as
he
chose
but
in
consequence
of
it
we
have
been
obliged
to
make
large
purchases
of
linen
china
c
to
supply
the
place
of
what
was
taken
away
you
may
guess
after
all
these
expenses
how
very
far
we
must
be
from
being
rich
and
how
acceptable
mrs
ferrars
s
kindness
is
certainly
said
elinor
and
assisted
by
her
liberality
i
hope
you
may
yet
live
to
be
in
easy
circumstances
another
year
or
two
may
do
much
towards
it
he
gravely
replied
but
however
there
is
still
a
great
deal
to
be
done
there
is
not
a
stone
laid
of
fanny
s
green
house
and
nothing
but
the
plan
of
the
flower
garden
marked
out
where
is
the
green
house
to
be
upon
the
knoll
behind
the
house
the
old
walnut
trees
are
all
come
down
to
make
room
for
it
it
will
be
a
very
fine
object
from
many
parts
of
the
park
and
the
flower
garden
will
slope
down
just
before
it
and
be
exceedingly
pretty
we
have
cleared
away
all
the
old
thorns
that
grew
in
patches
over
the
brow
elinor
kept
her
concern
and
her
censure
to
herself
and
was
very
thankful
that
marianne
was
not
present
to
share
the
provocation
having
now
said
enough
to
make
his
poverty
clear
and
to
do
away
the
necessity
of
buying
a
pair
of
ear
rings
for
each
of
his
sisters
in
his
next
visit
at
gray
s
his
thoughts
took
a
cheerfuller
turn
and
he
began
to
congratulate
elinor
on
having
such
a
friend
as
mrs
jennings
she
seems
a
most
valuable
woman
indeed
her
house
her
style
of
living
all
bespeak
an
exceeding
good
income
and
it
is
an
acquaintance
that
has
not
only
been
of
great
use
to
you
hitherto
but
in
the
end
may
prove
materially
advantageous
her
inviting
you
to
town
is
certainly
a
vast
thing
in
your
favour
and
indeed
it
speaks
altogether
so
great
a
regard
for
you
that
in
all
probability
when
she
dies
you
will
not
be
forgotten
she
must
have
a
great
deal
to
leave
nothing
at
all
i
should
rather
suppose
for
she
has
only
her
jointure
which
will
descend
to
her
children
but
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
that
she
lives
up
to
her
income
few
people
of
common
prudence
will
do
that
and
whatever
she
saves
she
will
be
able
to
dispose
of
and
do
you
not
think
it
more
likely
that
she
should
leave
it
to
her
daughters
than
to
us
her
daughters
are
both
exceedingly
well
married
and
therefore
i
cannot
perceive
the
necessity
of
her
remembering
them
farther
whereas
in
my
opinion
by
her
taking
so
much
notice
of
you
and
treating
you
in
this
kind
of
way
she
has
given
you
a
sort
of
claim
on
her
future
consideration
which
a
conscientious
woman
would
not
disregard
nothing
can
be
kinder
than
her
behaviour
and
she
can
hardly
do
all
this
without
being
aware
of
the
expectation
it
raises
but
she
raises
none
in
those
most
concerned
indeed
brother
your
anxiety
for
our
welfare
and
prosperity
carries
you
too
far
why
to
be
sure
said
he
seeming
to
recollect
himself
people
have
little
have
very
little
in
their
power
but
my
dear
elinor
what
is
the
matter
with
marianne
she
looks
very
unwell
has
lost
her
colour
and
is
grown
quite
thin
is
she
ill
she
is
not
well
she
has
had
a
nervous
complaint
on
her
for
several
weeks
i
am
sorry
for
that
at
her
time
of
life
any
thing
of
an
illness
destroys
the
bloom
for
ever
hers
has
been
a
very
short
one
she
was
as
handsome
a
girl
last
september
as
i
ever
saw
and
as
likely
to
attract
the
man
there
was
something
in
her
style
of
beauty
to
please
them
particularly
i
remember
fanny
used
to
say
that
she
would
marry
sooner
and
better
than
you
did
not
but
what
she
is
exceedingly
fond
of
you
but
so
it
happened
to
strike
her
she
will
be
mistaken
however
i
question
whether
marianne
now
will
marry
a
man
worth
more
than
five
or
six
hundred
a
year
at
the
utmost
and
i
am
very
much
deceived
if
you
do
not
do
better
dorsetshire
i
know
very
little
of
dorsetshire
but
my
dear
elinor
i
shall
be
exceedingly
glad
to
know
more
of
it
and
i
think
i
can
answer
for
your
having
fanny
and
myself
among
the
earliest
and
best
pleased
of
your
visitors
elinor
tried
very
seriously
to
convince
him
that
there
was
no
likelihood
of
her
marrying
colonel
brandon
but
it
was
an
expectation
of
too
much
pleasure
to
himself
to
be
relinquished
and
he
was
really
resolved
on
seeking
an
intimacy
with
that
gentleman
and
promoting
the
marriage
by
every
possible
attention
he
had
just
compunction
enough
for
having
done
nothing
for
his
sisters
himself
to
be
exceedingly
anxious
that
everybody
else
should
do
a
great
deal
and
an
offer
from
colonel
brandon
or
a
legacy
from
mrs
jennings
was
the
easiest
means
of
atoning
for
his
own
neglect
they
were
lucky
enough
to
find
lady
middleton
at
home
and
sir
john
came
in
before
their
visit
ended
abundance
of
civilities
passed
on
all
sides
sir
john
was
ready
to
like
anybody
and
though
mr
dashwood
did
not
seem
to
know
much
about
horses
he
soon
set
him
down
as
a
very
good
natured
fellow
while
lady
middleton
saw
enough
of
fashion
in
his
appearance
to
think
his
acquaintance
worth
having
and
mr
dashwood
went
away
delighted
with
both
i
shall
have
a
charming
account
to
carry
to
fanny
said
he
as
he
walked
back
with
his
sister
lady
middleton
is
really
a
most
elegant
woman
such
a
woman
as
i
am
sure
fanny
will
be
glad
to
know
and
mrs
jennings
too
an
exceedingly
well
behaved
woman
though
not
so
elegant
as
her
daughter
your
sister
need
not
have
any
scruple
even
of
visiting
her
which
to
say
the
truth
has
been
a
little
the
case
and
very
naturally
for
we
only
knew
that
mrs
jennings
was
the
widow
of
a
man
who
had
got
all
his
money
in
a
low
way
and
fanny
and
mrs
ferrars
were
both
strongly
prepossessed
that
neither
she
nor
her
daughters
were
such
kind
of
women
as
fanny
would
like
to
associate
with
but
now
i
can
carry
her
a
most
satisfactory
account
of
both
mrs
john
dashwood
had
so
much
confidence
in
her
husband
s
judgment
that
she
waited
the
very
next
day
both
on
mrs
jennings
and
her
daughter
and
her
confidence
was
rewarded
by
finding
even
the
former
even
the
woman
with
whom
her
sisters
were
staying
by
no
means
unworthy
her
notice
and
as
for
lady
middleton
she
found
her
one
of
the
most
charming
women
in
the
world
lady
middleton
was
equally
pleased
with
mrs
dashwood
there
was
a
kind
of
cold
hearted
selfishness
on
both
sides
which
mutually
attracted
them
and
they
sympathised
with
each
other
in
an
insipid
propriety
of
demeanor
and
a
general
want
of
understanding
the
same
manners
however
which
recommended
mrs
john
dashwood
to
the
good
opinion
of
lady
middleton
did
not
suit
the
fancy
of
mrs
jennings
and
to
her
she
appeared
nothing
more
than
a
little
proud
looking
woman
of
uncordial
address
who
met
her
husband
s
sisters
without
any
affection
and
almost
without
having
anything
to
say
to
them
for
of
the
quarter
of
an
hour
bestowed
on
berkeley
street
she
sat
at
least
seven
minutes
and
a
half
in
silence
elinor
wanted
very
much
to
know
though
she
did
not
chuse
to
ask
whether
edward
was
then
in
town
but
nothing
would
have
induced
fanny
voluntarily
to
mention
his
name
before
her
till
able
to
tell
her
that
his
marriage
with
miss
morton
was
resolved
on
or
till
her
husband
s
expectations
on
colonel
brandon
were
answered
because
she
believed
them
still
so
very
much
attached
to
each
other
that
they
could
not
be
too
sedulously
divided
in
word
and
deed
on
every
occasion
the
intelligence
however
which
she
would
not
give
soon
flowed
from
another
quarter
lucy
came
very
shortly
to
claim
elinor
s
compassion
on
being
unable
to
see
edward
though
he
had
arrived
in
town
with
mr
and
mrs
dashwood
he
dared
not
come
to
bartlett
s
buildings
for
fear
of
detection
and
though
their
mutual
impatience
to
meet
was
not
to
be
told
they
could
do
nothing
at
present
but
write
edward
assured
them
himself
of
his
being
in
town
within
a
very
short
time
by
twice
calling
in
berkeley
street
twice
was
his
card
found
on
the
table
when
they
returned
from
their
morning
s
engagements
elinor
was
pleased
that
he
had
called
and
still
more
pleased
that
she
had
missed
him
the
dashwoods
were
so
prodigiously
delighted
with
the
middletons
that
though
not
much
in
the
habit
of
giving
anything
they
determined
to
give
them
a
dinner
and
soon
after
their
acquaintance
began
invited
them
to
dine
in
harley
street
where
they
had
taken
a
very
good
house
for
three
months
their
sisters
and
mrs
jennings
were
invited
likewise
and
john
dashwood
was
careful
to
secure
colonel
brandon
who
always
glad
to
be
where
the
miss
dashwoods
were
received
his
eager
civilities
with
some
surprise
but
much
more
pleasure
they
were
to
meet
mrs
ferrars
but
elinor
could
not
learn
whether
her
sons
were
to
be
of
the
party
the
expectation
of
seeing
her
however
was
enough
to
make
her
interested
in
the
engagement
for
though
she
could
now
meet
edward
s
mother
without
that
strong
anxiety
which
had
once
promised
to
attend
such
an
introduction
though
she
could
now
see
her
with
perfect
indifference
as
to
her
opinion
of
herself
her
desire
of
being
in
company
with
mrs
ferrars
her
curiosity
to
know
what
she
was
like
was
as
lively
as
ever
the
interest
with
which
she
thus
anticipated
the
party
was
soon
afterwards
increased
more
powerfully
than
pleasantly
by
her
hearing
that
the
miss
steeles
were
also
to
be
at
it
so
well
had
they
recommended
themselves
to
lady
middleton
so
agreeable
had
their
assiduities
made
them
to
her
that
though
lucy
was
certainly
not
so
elegant
and
her
sister
not
even
genteel
she
was
as
ready
as
sir
john
to
ask
them
to
spend
a
week
or
two
in
conduit
street
and
it
happened
to
be
particularly
convenient
to
the
miss
steeles
as
soon
as
the
dashwoods
invitation
was
known
that
their
visit
should
begin
a
few
days
before
the
party
took
place
their
claims
to
the
notice
of
mrs
john
dashwood
as
the
nieces
of
the
gentleman
who
for
many
years
had
had
the
care
of
her
brother
might
not
have
done
much
however
towards
procuring
them
seats
at
her
table
but
as
lady
middleton
s
guests
they
must
be
welcome
and
lucy
who
had
long
wanted
to
be
personally
known
to
the
family
to
have
a
nearer
view
of
their
characters
and
her
own
difficulties
and
to
have
an
opportunity
of
endeavouring
to
please
them
had
seldom
been
happier
in
her
life
than
she
was
on
receiving
mrs
john
dashwood
s
card
on
elinor
its
effect
was
very
different
she
began
immediately
to
determine
that
edward
who
lived
with
his
mother
must
be
asked
as
his
mother
was
to
a
party
given
by
his
sister
and
to
see
him
for
the
first
time
after
all
that
passed
in
the
company
of
lucy
she
hardly
knew
how
she
could
bear
it
these
apprehensions
perhaps
were
not
founded
entirely
on
reason
and
certainly
not
at
all
on
truth
they
were
relieved
however
not
by
her
own
recollection
but
by
the
good
will
of
lucy
who
believed
herself
to
be
inflicting
a
severe
disappointment
when
she
told
her
that
edward
certainly
would
not
be
in
harley
street
on
tuesday
and
even
hoped
to
be
carrying
the
pain
still
farther
by
persuading
her
that
he
was
kept
away
by
the
extreme
affection
for
herself
which
he
could
not
conceal
when
they
were
together
the
important
tuesday
came
that
was
to
introduce
the
two
young
ladies
to
this
formidable
mother
in
law
pity
me
dear
miss
dashwood
said
lucy
as
they
walked
up
the
stairs
together
for
the
middletons
arrived
so
directly
after
mrs
jennings
that
they
all
followed
the
servant
at
the
same
time
there
is
nobody
here
but
you
that
can
feel
for
me
i
declare
i
can
hardly
stand
good
gracious
in
a
moment
i
shall
see
the
person
that
all
my
happiness
depends
on
that
is
to
be
my
mother
elinor
could
have
given
her
immediate
relief
by
suggesting
the
possibility
of
its
being
miss
morton
s
mother
rather
than
her
own
whom
they
were
about
to
behold
but
instead
of
doing
that
she
assured
her
and
with
great
sincerity
that
she
did
pity
her
to
the
utter
amazement
of
lucy
who
though
really
uncomfortable
herself
hoped
at
least
to
be
an
object
of
irrepressible
envy
to
elinor
mrs
ferrars
was
a
little
thin
woman
upright
even
to
formality
in
her
figure
and
serious
even
to
sourness
in
her
aspect
her
complexion
was
sallow
and
her
features
small
without
beauty
and
naturally
without
expression
but
a
lucky
contraction
of
the
brow
had
rescued
her
countenance
from
the
disgrace
of
insipidity
by
giving
it
the
strong
characters
of
pride
and
ill
nature
she
was
not
a
woman
of
many
words
for
unlike
people
in
general
she
proportioned
them
to
the
number
of
her
ideas
and
of
the
few
syllables
that
did
escape
her
not
one
fell
to
the
share
of
miss
dashwood
whom
she
eyed
with
the
spirited
determination
of
disliking
her
at
all
events
elinor
could
not
now
be
made
unhappy
by
this
behaviour
a
few
months
ago
it
would
have
hurt
her
exceedingly
but
it
was
not
in
mrs
ferrars
power
to
distress
her
by
it
now
and
the
difference
of
her
manners
to
the
miss
steeles
a
difference
which
seemed
purposely
made
to
humble
her
more
only
amused
her
she
could
not
but
smile
to
see
the
graciousness
of
both
mother
and
daughter
towards
the
very
person
for
lucy
was
particularly
distinguished
whom
of
all
others
had
they
known
as
much
as
she
did
they
would
have
been
most
anxious
to
mortify
while
she
herself
who
had
comparatively
no
power
to
wound
them
sat
pointedly
slighted
by
both
but
while
she
smiled
at
a
graciousness
so
misapplied
she
could
not
reflect
on
the
mean
spirited
folly
from
which
it
sprung
nor
observe
the
studied
attentions
with
which
the
miss
steeles
courted
its
continuance
without
thoroughly
despising
them
all
four
lucy
was
all
exultation
on
being
so
honorably
distinguished
and
miss
steele
wanted
only
to
be
teazed
about
dr
davies
to
be
perfectly
happy
the
dinner
was
a
grand
one
the
servants
were
numerous
and
every
thing
bespoke
the
mistress
s
inclination
for
show
and
the
master
s
ability
to
support
it
in
spite
of
the
improvements
and
additions
which
were
making
to
the
norland
estate
and
in
spite
of
its
owner
having
once
been
within
some
thousand
pounds
of
being
obliged
to
sell
out
at
a
loss
nothing
gave
any
symptom
of
that
indigence
which
he
had
tried
to
infer
from
it
no
poverty
of
any
kind
except
of
conversation
appeared
but
there
the
deficiency
was
considerable
john
dashwood
had
not
much
to
say
for
himself
that
was
worth
hearing
and
his
wife
had
still
less
but
there
was
no
peculiar
disgrace
in
this
for
it
was
very
much
the
case
with
the
chief
of
their
visitors
who
almost
all
laboured
under
one
or
other
of
these
disqualifications
for
being
agreeable
want
of
sense
either
natural
or
improved
want
of
elegance
want
of
spirits
or
want
of
temper
when
the
ladies
withdrew
to
the
drawing
room
after
dinner
this
poverty
was
particularly
evident
for
the
gentlemen
had
supplied
the
discourse
with
some
variety
the
variety
of
politics
inclosing
land
and
breaking
horses
but
then
it
was
all
over
and
one
subject
only
engaged
the
ladies
till
coffee
came
in
which
was
the
comparative
heights
of
harry
dashwood
and
lady
middleton
s
second
son
william
who
were
nearly
of
the
same
age
had
both
the
children
been
there
the
affair
might
have
been
determined
too
easily
by
measuring
them
at
once
but
as
harry
only
was
present
it
was
all
conjectural
assertion
on
both
sides
and
every
body
had
a
right
to
be
equally
positive
in
their
opinion
and
to
repeat
it
over
and
over
again
as
often
as
they
liked
the
parties
stood
thus
the
two
mothers
though
each
really
convinced
that
her
own
son
was
the
tallest
politely
decided
in
favour
of
the
other
the
two
grandmothers
with
not
less
partiality
but
more
sincerity
were
equally
earnest
in
support
of
their
own
descendant
lucy
who
was
hardly
less
anxious
to
please
one
parent
than
the
other
thought
the
boys
were
both
remarkably
tall
for
their
age
and
could
not
conceive
that
there
could
be
the
smallest
difference
in
the
world
between
them
and
miss
steele
with
yet
greater
address
gave
it
as
fast
as
she
could
in
favour
of
each
elinor
having
once
delivered
her
opinion
on
william
s
side
by
which
she
offended
mrs
ferrars
and
fanny
still
more
did
not
see
the
necessity
of
enforcing
it
by
any
farther
assertion
and
marianne
when
called
on
for
hers
offended
them
all
by
declaring
that
she
had
no
opinion
to
give
as
she
had
never
thought
about
it
before
her
removing
from
norland
elinor
had
painted
a
very
pretty
pair
of
screens
for
her
sister
in
law
which
being
now
just
mounted
and
brought
home
ornamented
her
present
drawing
room
and
these
screens
catching
the
eye
of
john
dashwood
on
his
following
the
other
gentlemen
into
the
room
were
officiously
handed
by
him
to
colonel
brandon
for
his
admiration
these
are
done
by
my
eldest
sister
said
he
and
you
as
a
man
of
taste
will
i
dare
say
be
pleased
with
them
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
ever
happened
to
see
any
of
her
performances
before
but
she
is
in
general
reckoned
to
draw
extremely
well
the
colonel
though
disclaiming
all
pretensions
to
connoisseurship
warmly
admired
the
screens
as
he
would
have
done
any
thing
painted
by
miss
dashwood
and
on
the
curiosity
of
the
others
being
of
course
excited
they
were
handed
round
for
general
inspection
mrs
ferrars
not
aware
of
their
being
elinor
s
work
particularly
requested
to
look
at
them
and
after
they
had
received
gratifying
testimony
of
lady
middletons
s
approbation
fanny
presented
them
to
her
mother
considerately
informing
her
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
done
by
miss
dashwood
hum
said
mrs
ferrars
very
pretty
and
without
regarding
them
at
all
returned
them
to
her
daughter
perhaps
fanny
thought
for
a
moment
that
her
mother
had
been
quite
rude
enough
for
colouring
a
little
she
immediately
said
they
are
very
pretty
ma
am
an
t
they
but
then
again
the
dread
of
having
been
too
civil
too
encouraging
herself
probably
came
over
her
for
she
presently
added
do
you
not
think
they
are
something
in
miss
morton
s
style
of
painting
ma
am
she
does
paint
most
delightfully
how
beautifully
her
last
landscape
is
done
beautifully
indeed
but
she
does
every
thing
well
marianne
could
not
bear
this
she
was
already
greatly
displeased
with
mrs
ferrars
and
such
ill
timed
praise
of
another
at
elinor
s
expense
though
she
had
not
any
notion
of
what
was
principally
meant
by
it
provoked
her
immediately
to
say
with
warmth
this
is
admiration
of
a
very
particular
kind
what
is
miss
morton
to
us
who
knows
or
who
cares
for
her
it
is
elinor
of
whom
we
think
and
speak
and
so
saying
she
took
the
screens
out
of
her
sister
in
law
s
hands
to
admire
them
herself
as
they
ought
to
be
admired
mrs
ferrars
looked
exceedingly
angry
and
drawing
herself
up
more
stiffly
than
ever
pronounced
in
retort
this
bitter
philippic
miss
morton
is
lord
morton
s
daughter
fanny
looked
very
angry
too
and
her
husband
was
all
in
a
fright
at
his
sister
s
audacity
elinor
was
much
more
hurt
by
marianne
s
warmth
than
she
had
been
by
what
produced
it
but
colonel
brandon
s
eyes
as
they
were
fixed
on
marianne
declared
that
he
noticed
only
what
was
amiable
in
it
the
affectionate
heart
which
could
not
bear
to
see
a
sister
slighted
in
the
smallest
point
marianne
s
feelings
did
not
stop
here
the
cold
insolence
of
mrs
ferrars
s
general
behaviour
to
her
sister
seemed
to
her
to
foretell
such
difficulties
and
distresses
to
elinor
as
her
own
wounded
heart
taught
her
to
think
of
with
horror
and
urged
by
a
strong
impulse
of
affectionate
sensibility
she
moved
after
a
moment
to
her
sister
s
chair
and
putting
one
arm
round
her
neck
and
one
cheek
close
to
hers
said
in
a
low
but
eager
voice
dear
dear
elinor
don
t
mind
them
don
t
let
them
make
you
unhappy
she
could
say
no
more
her
spirits
were
quite
overcome
and
hiding
her
face
on
elinor
s
shoulder
she
burst
into
tears
every
body
s
attention
was
called
and
almost
every
body
was
concerned
colonel
brandon
rose
up
and
went
to
them
without
knowing
what
he
did
mrs
jennings
with
a
very
intelligent
ah
poor
dear
immediately
gave
her
her
salts
and
sir
john
felt
so
desperately
enraged
against
the
author
of
this
nervous
distress
that
he
instantly
changed
his
seat
to
one
close
by
lucy
steele
and
gave
her
in
a
whisper
a
brief
account
of
the
whole
shocking
affair
in
a
few
minutes
however
marianne
was
recovered
enough
to
put
an
end
to
the
bustle
and
sit
down
among
the
rest
though
her
spirits
retained
the
impression
of
what
had
passed
the
whole
evening
poor
marianne
said
her
brother
to
colonel
brandon
in
a
low
voice
as
soon
as
he
could
secure
his
attention
she
has
not
such
good
health
as
her
sister
she
is
very
nervous
she
has
not
elinor
s
constitution
and
one
must
allow
that
there
is
something
very
trying
to
a
young
woman
who
has
been
a
beauty
in
the
loss
of
her
personal
attractions
you
would
not
think
it
perhaps
but
marianne
was
remarkably
handsome
a
few
months
ago
quite
as
handsome
as
elinor
now
you
see
it
is
all
gone
elinor
s
curiosity
to
see
mrs
ferrars
was
satisfied
she
had
found
in
her
every
thing
that
could
tend
to
make
a
farther
connection
between
the
families
undesirable
she
had
seen
enough
of
her
pride
her
meanness
and
her
determined
prejudice
against
herself
to
comprehend
all
the
difficulties
that
must
have
perplexed
the
engagement
and
retarded
the
marriage
of
edward
and
herself
had
he
been
otherwise
free
and
she
had
seen
almost
enough
to
be
thankful
for
her
own
sake
that
one
greater
obstacle
preserved
her
from
suffering
under
any
other
of
mrs
ferrars
s
creation
preserved
her
from
all
dependence
upon
her
caprice
or
any
solicitude
for
her
good
opinion
or
at
least
if
she
did
not
bring
herself
quite
to
rejoice
in
edward
s
being
fettered
to
lucy
she
determined
that
had
lucy
been
more
amiable
she
ought
to
have
rejoiced
she
wondered
that
lucy
s
spirits
could
be
so
very
much
elevated
by
the
civility
of
mrs
ferrars
that
her
interest
and
her
vanity
should
so
very
much
blind
her
as
to
make
the
attention
which
seemed
only
paid
her
because
she
was
not
elinor
appear
a
compliment
to
herself
or
to
allow
her
to
derive
encouragement
from
a
preference
only
given
her
because
her
real
situation
was
unknown
but
that
it
was
so
had
not
only
been
declared
by
lucy
s
eyes
at
the
time
but
was
declared
over
again
the
next
morning
more
openly
for
at
her
particular
desire
lady
middleton
set
her
down
in
berkeley
street
on
the
chance
of
seeing
elinor
alone
to
tell
her
how
happy
she
was
the
chance
proved
a
lucky
one
for
a
message
from
mrs
palmer
soon
after
she
arrived
carried
mrs
jennings
away
my
dear
friend
cried
lucy
as
soon
as
they
were
by
themselves
i
come
to
talk
to
you
of
my
happiness
could
anything
be
so
flattering
as
mrs
ferrars
s
way
of
treating
me
yesterday
so
exceeding
affable
as
she
was
you
know
how
i
dreaded
the
thoughts
of
seeing
her
but
the
very
moment
i
was
introduced
there
was
such
an
affability
in
her
behaviour
as
really
should
seem
to
say
she
had
quite
took
a
fancy
to
me
now
was
not
it
so
you
saw
it
all
and
was
not
you
quite
struck
with
it
she
was
certainly
very
civil
to
you
civil
did
you
see
nothing
but
only
civility
i
saw
a
vast
deal
more
such
kindness
as
fell
to
the
share
of
nobody
but
me
no
pride
no
hauteur
and
your
sister
just
the
same
all
sweetness
and
affability
elinor
wished
to
talk
of
something
else
but
lucy
still
pressed
her
to
own
that
she
had
reason
for
her
happiness
and
elinor
was
obliged
to
go
on
undoubtedly
if
they
had
known
your
engagement
said
she
nothing
could
be
more
flattering
than
their
treatment
of
you
but
as
that
was
not
the
case
i
guessed
you
would
say
so
replied
lucy
quickly
but
there
was
no
reason
in
the
world
why
mrs
ferrars
should
seem
to
like
me
if
she
did
not
and
her
liking
me
is
every
thing
you
shan
t
talk
me
out
of
my
satisfaction
i
am
sure
it
will
all
end
well
and
there
will
be
no
difficulties
at
all
to
what
i
used
to
think
mrs
ferrars
is
a
charming
woman
and
so
is
your
sister
they
are
both
delightful
women
indeed
i
wonder
i
should
never
hear
you
say
how
agreeable
mrs
dashwood
was
to
this
elinor
had
no
answer
to
make
and
did
not
attempt
any
are
you
ill
miss
dashwood
you
seem
low
you
don
t
speak
sure
you
an
t
well
i
never
was
in
better
health
i
am
glad
of
it
with
all
my
heart
but
really
you
did
not
look
it
i
should
be
sorry
to
have
you
ill
you
that
have
been
the
greatest
comfort
to
me
in
the
world
heaven
knows
what
i
should
have
done
without
your
friendship
elinor
tried
to
make
a
civil
answer
though
doubting
her
own
success
but
it
seemed
to
satisfy
lucy
for
she
directly
replied
indeed
i
am
perfectly
convinced
of
your
regard
for
me
and
next
to
edward
s
love
it
is
the
greatest
comfort
i
have
poor
edward
but
now
there
is
one
good
thing
we
shall
be
able
to
meet
and
meet
pretty
often
for
lady
middleton
s
delighted
with
mrs
dashwood
so
we
shall
be
a
good
deal
in
harley
street
i
dare
say
and
edward
spends
half
his
time
with
his
sister
besides
lady
middleton
and
mrs
ferrars
will
visit
now
and
mrs
ferrars
and
your
sister
were
both
so
good
to
say
more
than
once
they
should
always
be
glad
to
see
me
they
are
such
charming
women
i
am
sure
if
ever
you
tell
your
sister
what
i
think
of
her
you
cannot
speak
too
high
but
elinor
would
not
give
her
any
encouragement
to
hope
that
she
should
tell
her
sister
lucy
continued
i
am
sure
i
should
have
seen
it
in
a
moment
if
mrs
ferrars
had
took
a
dislike
to
me
if
she
had
only
made
me
a
formal
courtesy
for
instance
without
saying
a
word
and
never
after
had
took
any
notice
of
me
and
never
looked
at
me
in
a
pleasant
way
you
know
what
i
mean
if
i
had
been
treated
in
that
forbidding
sort
of
way
i
should
have
gave
it
all
up
in
despair
i
could
not
have
stood
it
for
where
she
does
dislike
i
know
it
is
most
violent
elinor
was
prevented
from
making
any
reply
to
this
civil
triumph
by
the
door
s
being
thrown
open
the
servant
s
announcing
mr
ferrars
and
edward
s
immediately
walking
in
it
was
a
very
awkward
moment
and
the
countenance
of
each
shewed
that
it
was
so
they
all
looked
exceedingly
foolish
and
edward
seemed
to
have
as
great
an
inclination
to
walk
out
of
the
room
again
as
to
advance
farther
into
it
the
very
circumstance
in
its
unpleasantest
form
which
they
would
each
have
been
most
anxious
to
avoid
had
fallen
on
them
they
were
not
only
all
three
together
but
were
together
without
the
relief
of
any
other
person
the
ladies
recovered
themselves
first
it
was
not
lucy
s
business
to
put
herself
forward
and
the
appearance
of
secrecy
must
still
be
kept
up
she
could
therefore
only
look
her
tenderness
and
after
slightly
addressing
him
said
no
more
but
elinor
had
more
to
do
and
so
anxious
was
she
for
his
sake
and
her
own
to
do
it
well
that
she
forced
herself
after
a
moment
s
recollection
to
welcome
him
with
a
look
and
manner
that
were
almost
easy
and
almost
open
and
another
struggle
another
effort
still
improved
them
she
would
not
allow
the
presence
of
lucy
nor
the
consciousness
of
some
injustice
towards
herself
to
deter
her
from
saying
that
she
was
happy
to
see
him
and
that
she
had
very
much
regretted
being
from
home
when
he
called
before
in
berkeley
street
she
would
not
be
frightened
from
paying
him
those
attentions
which
as
a
friend
and
almost
a
relation
were
his
due
by
the
observant
eyes
of
lucy
though
she
soon
perceived
them
to
be
narrowly
watching
her
her
manners
gave
some
re
assurance
to
edward
and
he
had
courage
enough
to
sit
down
but
his
embarrassment
still
exceeded
that
of
the
ladies
in
a
proportion
which
the
case
rendered
reasonable
though
his
sex
might
make
it
rare
for
his
heart
had
not
the
indifference
of
lucy
s
nor
could
his
conscience
have
quite
the
ease
of
elinor
s
lucy
with
a
demure
and
settled
air
seemed
determined
to
make
no
contribution
to
the
comfort
of
the
others
and
would
not
say
a
word
and
almost
every
thing
that
was
said
proceeded
from
elinor
who
was
obliged
to
volunteer
all
the
information
about
her
mother
s
health
their
coming
to
town
c
which
edward
ought
to
have
inquired
about
but
never
did
her
exertions
did
not
stop
here
for
she
soon
afterwards
felt
herself
so
heroically
disposed
as
to
determine
under
pretence
of
fetching
marianne
to
leave
the
others
by
themselves
and
she
really
did
it
and
that
in
the
handsomest
manner
for
she
loitered
away
several
minutes
on
the
landing
place
with
the
most
high
minded
fortitude
before
she
went
to
her
sister
when
that
was
once
done
however
it
was
time
for
the
raptures
of
edward
to
cease
for
marianne
s
joy
hurried
her
into
the
drawing
room
immediately
her
pleasure
in
seeing
him
was
like
every
other
of
her
feelings
strong
in
itself
and
strongly
spoken
she
met
him
with
a
hand
that
would
be
taken
and
a
voice
that
expressed
the
affection
of
a
sister
dear
edward
she
cried
this
is
a
moment
of
great
happiness
this
would
almost
make
amends
for
every
thing
edward
tried
to
return
her
kindness
as
it
deserved
but
before
such
witnesses
he
dared
not
say
half
what
he
really
felt
again
they
all
sat
down
and
for
a
moment
or
two
all
were
silent
while
marianne
was
looking
with
the
most
speaking
tenderness
sometimes
at
edward
and
sometimes
at
elinor
regretting
only
that
their
delight
in
each
other
should
be
checked
by
lucy
s
unwelcome
presence
edward
was
the
first
to
speak
and
it
was
to
notice
marianne
s
altered
looks
and
express
his
fear
of
her
not
finding
london
agree
with
her
oh
don
t
think
of
me
she
replied
with
spirited
earnestness
though
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
as
she
spoke
don
t
think
of
my
health
elinor
is
well
you
see
that
must
be
enough
for
us
both
this
remark
was
not
calculated
to
make
edward
or
elinor
more
easy
nor
to
conciliate
the
good
will
of
lucy
who
looked
up
at
marianne
with
no
very
benignant
expression
do
you
like
london
said
edward
willing
to
say
any
thing
that
might
introduce
another
subject
not
at
all
i
expected
much
pleasure
in
it
but
i
have
found
none
the
sight
of
you
edward
is
the
only
comfort
it
has
afforded
and
thank
heaven
you
are
what
you
always
were
she
paused
no
one
spoke
i
think
elinor
she
presently
added
we
must
employ
edward
to
take
care
of
us
in
our
return
to
barton
in
a
week
or
two
i
suppose
we
shall
be
going
and
i
trust
edward
will
not
be
very
unwilling
to
accept
the
charge
poor
edward
muttered
something
but
what
it
was
nobody
knew
not
even
himself
but
marianne
who
saw
his
agitation
and
could
easily
trace
it
to
whatever
cause
best
pleased
herself
was
perfectly
satisfied
and
soon
talked
of
something
else
we
spent
such
a
day
edward
in
harley
street
yesterday
so
dull
so
wretchedly
dull
but
i
have
much
to
say
to
you
on
that
head
which
cannot
be
said
now
and
with
this
admirable
discretion
did
she
defer
the
assurance
of
her
finding
their
mutual
relatives
more
disagreeable
than
ever
and
of
her
being
particularly
disgusted
with
his
mother
till
they
were
more
in
private
but
why
were
you
not
there
edward
why
did
you
not
come
i
was
engaged
elsewhere
engaged
but
what
was
that
when
such
friends
were
to
be
met
perhaps
miss
marianne
cried
lucy
eager
to
take
some
revenge
on
her
you
think
young
men
never
stand
upon
engagements
if
they
have
no
mind
to
keep
them
little
as
well
as
great
elinor
was
very
angry
but
marianne
seemed
entirely
insensible
of
the
sting
for
she
calmly
replied
not
so
indeed
for
seriously
speaking
i
am
very
sure
that
conscience
only
kept
edward
from
harley
street
and
i
really
believe
he
has
the
most
delicate
conscience
in
the
world
the
most
scrupulous
in
performing
every
engagement
however
minute
and
however
it
may
make
against
his
interest
or
pleasure
he
is
the
most
fearful
of
giving
pain
of
wounding
expectation
and
the
most
incapable
of
being
selfish
of
any
body
i
ever
saw
edward
it
is
so
and
i
will
say
it
what
are
you
never
to
hear
yourself
praised
then
you
must
be
no
friend
of
mine
for
those
who
will
accept
of
my
love
and
esteem
must
submit
to
my
open
commendation
the
nature
of
her
commendation
in
the
present
case
however
happened
to
be
particularly
ill
suited
to
the
feelings
of
two
thirds
of
her
auditors
and
was
so
very
unexhilarating
to
edward
that
he
very
soon
got
up
to
go
away
going
so
soon
said
marianne
my
dear
edward
this
must
not
be
and
drawing
him
a
little
aside
she
whispered
her
persuasion
that
lucy
could
not
stay
much
longer
but
even
this
encouragement
failed
for
he
would
go
and
lucy
who
would
have
outstaid
him
had
his
visit
lasted
two
hours
soon
afterwards
went
away
what
can
bring
her
here
so
often
said
marianne
on
her
leaving
them
could
not
she
see
that
we
wanted
her
gone
how
teazing
to
edward
why
so
we
were
all
his
friends
and
lucy
has
been
the
longest
known
to
him
of
any
it
is
but
natural
that
he
should
like
to
see
her
as
well
as
ourselves
marianne
looked
at
her
steadily
and
said
you
know
elinor
that
this
is
a
kind
of
talking
which
i
cannot
bear
if
you
only
hope
to
have
your
assertion
contradicted
as
i
must
suppose
to
be
the
case
you
ought
to
recollect
that
i
am
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
do
it
i
cannot
descend
to
be
tricked
out
of
assurances
that
are
not
really
wanted
she
then
left
the
room
and
elinor
dared
not
follow
her
to
say
more
for
bound
as
she
was
by
her
promise
of
secrecy
to
lucy
she
could
give
no
information
that
would
convince
marianne
and
painful
as
the
consequences
of
her
still
continuing
in
an
error
might
be
she
was
obliged
to
submit
to
it
all
that
she
could
hope
was
that
edward
would
not
often
expose
her
or
himself
to
the
distress
of
hearing
marianne
s
mistaken
warmth
nor
to
the
repetition
of
any
other
part
of
the
pain
that
had
attended
their
recent
meeting
and
this
she
had
every
reason
to
expect
within
a
few
days
after
this
meeting
the
newspapers
announced
to
the
world
that
the
lady
of
thomas
palmer
esq
was
safely
delivered
of
a
son
and
heir
a
very
interesting
and
satisfactory
paragraph
at
least
to
all
those
intimate
connections
who
knew
it
before
this
event
highly
important
to
mrs
jennings
s
happiness
produced
a
temporary
alteration
in
the
disposal
of
her
time
and
influenced
in
a
like
degree
the
engagements
of
her
young
friends
for
as
she
wished
to
be
as
much
as
possible
with
charlotte
she
went
thither
every
morning
as
soon
as
she
was
dressed
and
did
not
return
till
late
in
the
evening
and
the
miss
dashwoods
at
the
particular
request
of
the
middletons
spent
the
whole
of
every
day
in
conduit
street
for
their
own
comfort
they
would
much
rather
have
remained
at
least
all
the
morning
in
mrs
jennings
s
house
but
it
was
not
a
thing
to
be
urged
against
the
wishes
of
everybody
their
hours
were
therefore
made
over
to
lady
middleton
and
the
two
miss
steeles
by
whom
their
company
in
fact
was
as
little
valued
as
it
was
professedly
sought
they
had
too
much
sense
to
be
desirable
companions
to
the
former
and
by
the
latter
they
were
considered
with
a
jealous
eye
as
intruding
on
their
ground
and
sharing
the
kindness
which
they
wanted
to
monopolize
though
nothing
could
be
more
polite
than
lady
middleton
s
behaviour
to
elinor
and
marianne
she
did
not
really
like
them
at
all
because
they
neither
flattered
herself
nor
her
children
she
could
not
believe
them
good
natured
and
because
they
were
fond
of
reading
she
fancied
them
satirical
perhaps
without
exactly
knowing
what
it
was
to
be
satirical
but
that
did
not
signify
it
was
censure
in
common
use
and
easily
given
their
presence
was
a
restraint
both
on
her
and
on
lucy
it
checked
the
idleness
of
one
and
the
business
of
the
other
lady
middleton
was
ashamed
of
doing
nothing
before
them
and
the
flattery
which
lucy
was
proud
to
think
of
and
administer
at
other
times
she
feared
they
would
despise
her
for
offering
miss
steele
was
the
least
discomposed
of
the
three
by
their
presence
and
it
was
in
their
power
to
reconcile
her
to
it
entirely
would
either
of
them
only
have
given
her
a
full
and
minute
account
of
the
whole
affair
between
marianne
and
mr
willoughby
she
would
have
thought
herself
amply
rewarded
for
the
sacrifice
of
the
best
place
by
the
fire
after
dinner
which
their
arrival
occasioned
but
this
conciliation
was
not
granted
for
though
she
often
threw
out
expressions
of
pity
for
her
sister
to
elinor
and
more
than
once
dropt
a
reflection
on
the
inconstancy
of
beaux
before
marianne
no
effect
was
produced
but
a
look
of
indifference
from
the
former
or
of
disgust
in
the
latter
an
effort
even
yet
lighter
might
have
made
her
their
friend
would
they
only
have
laughed
at
her
about
the
doctor
but
so
little
were
they
anymore
than
the
others
inclined
to
oblige
her
that
if
sir
john
dined
from
home
she
might
spend
a
whole
day
without
hearing
any
other
raillery
on
the
subject
than
what
she
was
kind
enough
to
bestow
on
herself
all
these
jealousies
and
discontents
however
were
so
totally
unsuspected
by
mrs
jennings
that
she
thought
it
a
delightful
thing
for
the
girls
to
be
together
and
generally
congratulated
her
young
friends
every
night
on
having
escaped
the
company
of
a
stupid
old
woman
so
long
she
joined
them
sometimes
at
sir
john
s
sometimes
at
her
own
house
but
wherever
it
was
she
always
came
in
excellent
spirits
full
of
delight
and
importance
attributing
charlotte
s
well
doing
to
her
own
care
and
ready
to
give
so
exact
so
minute
a
detail
of
her
situation
as
only
miss
steele
had
curiosity
enough
to
desire
one
thing
did
disturb
her
and
of
that
she
made
her
daily
complaint
mr
palmer
maintained
the
common
but
unfatherly
opinion
among
his
sex
of
all
infants
being
alike
and
though
she
could
plainly
perceive
at
different
times
the
most
striking
resemblance
between
this
baby
and
every
one
of
his
relations
on
both
sides
there
was
no
convincing
his
father
of
it
no
persuading
him
to
believe
that
it
was
not
exactly
like
every
other
baby
of
the
same
age
nor
could
he
even
be
brought
to
acknowledge
the
simple
proposition
of
its
being
the
finest
child
in
the
world
i
come
now
to
the
relation
of
a
misfortune
which
about
this
time
befell
mrs
john
dashwood
it
so
happened
that
while
her
two
sisters
with
mrs
jennings
were
first
calling
on
her
in
harley
street
another
of
her
acquaintance
had
dropt
in
a
circumstance
in
itself
not
apparently
likely
to
produce
evil
to
her
but
while
the
imaginations
of
other
people
will
carry
them
away
to
form
wrong
judgments
of
our
conduct
and
to
decide
on
it
by
slight
appearances
one
s
happiness
must
in
some
measure
be
always
at
the
mercy
of
chance
in
the
present
instance
this
last
arrived
lady
allowed
her
fancy
to
so
far
outrun
truth
and
probability
that
on
merely
hearing
the
name
of
the
miss
dashwoods
and
understanding
them
to
be
mr
dashwood
s
sisters
she
immediately
concluded
them
to
be
staying
in
harley
street
and
this
misconstruction
produced
within
a
day
or
two
afterwards
cards
of
invitation
for
them
as
well
as
for
their
brother
and
sister
to
a
small
musical
party
at
her
house
the
consequence
of
which
was
that
mrs
john
dashwood
was
obliged
to
submit
not
only
to
the
exceedingly
great
inconvenience
of
sending
her
carriage
for
the
miss
dashwoods
but
what
was
still
worse
must
be
subject
to
all
the
unpleasantness
of
appearing
to
treat
them
with
attention
and
who
could
tell
that
they
might
not
expect
to
go
out
with
her
a
second
time
the
power
of
disappointing
them
it
was
true
must
always
be
hers
but
that
was
not
enough
for
when
people
are
determined
on
a
mode
of
conduct
which
they
know
to
be
wrong
they
feel
injured
by
the
expectation
of
any
thing
better
from
them
marianne
had
now
been
brought
by
degrees
so
much
into
the
habit
of
going
out
every
day
that
it
was
become
a
matter
of
indifference
to
her
whether
she
went
or
not
and
she
prepared
quietly
and
mechanically
for
every
evening
s
engagement
though
without
expecting
the
smallest
amusement
from
any
and
very
often
without
knowing
till
the
last
moment
where
it
was
to
take
her
to
her
dress
and
appearance
she
was
grown
so
perfectly
indifferent
as
not
to
bestow
half
the
consideration
on
it
during
the
whole
of
her
toilet
which
it
received
from
miss
steele
in
the
first
five
minutes
of
their
being
together
when
it
was
finished
nothing
escaped
her
minute
observation
and
general
curiosity
she
saw
every
thing
and
asked
every
thing
was
never
easy
till
she
knew
the
price
of
every
part
of
marianne
s
dress
could
have
guessed
the
number
of
her
gowns
altogether
with
better
judgment
than
marianne
herself
and
was
not
without
hopes
of
finding
out
before
they
parted
how
much
her
washing
cost
per
week
and
how
much
she
had
every
year
to
spend
upon
herself
the
impertinence
of
these
kind
of
scrutinies
moreover
was
generally
concluded
with
a
compliment
which
though
meant
as
its
douceur
was
considered
by
marianne
as
the
greatest
impertinence
of
all
for
after
undergoing
an
examination
into
the
value
and
make
of
her
gown
the
colour
of
her
shoes
and
the
arrangement
of
her
hair
she
was
almost
sure
of
being
told
that
upon
her
word
she
looked
vastly
smart
and
she
dared
to
say
she
would
make
a
great
many
conquests
with
such
encouragement
as
this
was
she
dismissed
on
the
present
occasion
to
her
brother
s
carriage
which
they
were
ready
to
enter
five
minutes
after
it
stopped
at
the
door
a
punctuality
not
very
agreeable
to
their
sister
in
law
who
had
preceded
them
to
the
house
of
her
acquaintance
and
was
there
hoping
for
some
delay
on
their
part
that
might
inconvenience
either
herself
or
her
coachman
the
events
of
this
evening
were
not
very
remarkable
the
party
like
other
musical
parties
comprehended
a
great
many
people
who
had
real
taste
for
the
performance
and
a
great
many
more
who
had
none
at
all
and
the
performers
themselves
were
as
usual
in
their
own
estimation
and
that
of
their
immediate
friends
the
first
private
performers
in
england
as
elinor
was
neither
musical
nor
affecting
to
be
so
she
made
no
scruple
of
turning
her
eyes
from
the
grand
pianoforte
whenever
it
suited
her
and
unrestrained
even
by
the
presence
of
a
harp
and
violoncello
would
fix
them
at
pleasure
on
any
other
object
in
the
room
in
one
of
these
excursive
glances
she
perceived
among
a
group
of
young
men
the
very
he
who
had
given
them
a
lecture
on
toothpick
cases
at
gray
s
she
perceived
him
soon
afterwards
looking
at
herself
and
speaking
familiarly
to
her
brother
and
had
just
determined
to
find
out
his
name
from
the
latter
when
they
both
came
towards
her
and
mr
dashwood
introduced
him
to
her
as
mr
robert
ferrars
he
addressed
her
with
easy
civility
and
twisted
his
head
into
a
bow
which
assured
her
as
plainly
as
words
could
have
done
that
he
was
exactly
the
coxcomb
she
had
heard
him
described
to
be
by
lucy
happy
had
it
been
for
her
if
her
regard
for
edward
had
depended
less
on
his
own
merit
than
on
the
merit
of
his
nearest
relations
for
then
his
brother
s
bow
must
have
given
the
finishing
stroke
to
what
the
ill
humour
of
his
mother
and
sister
would
have
begun
but
while
she
wondered
at
the
difference
of
the
two
young
men
she
did
not
find
that
the
emptiness
of
conceit
of
the
one
put
her
out
of
all
charity
with
the
modesty
and
worth
of
the
other
why
they
were
different
robert
exclaimed
to
her
himself
in
the
course
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
conversation
for
talking
of
his
brother
and
lamenting
the
extreme
gaucherie
which
he
really
believed
kept
him
from
mixing
in
proper
society
he
candidly
and
generously
attributed
it
much
less
to
any
natural
deficiency
than
to
the
misfortune
of
a
private
education
while
he
himself
though
probably
without
any
particular
any
material
superiority
by
nature
merely
from
the
advantage
of
a
public
school
was
as
well
fitted
to
mix
in
the
world
as
any
other
man
upon
my
soul
he
added
i
believe
it
is
nothing
more
and
so
i
often
tell
my
mother
when
she
is
grieving
about
it
my
dear
madam
i
always
say
to
her
you
must
make
yourself
easy
the
evil
is
now
irremediable
and
it
has
been
entirely
your
own
doing
why
would
you
be
persuaded
by
my
uncle
sir
robert
against
your
own
judgment
to
place
edward
under
private
tuition
at
the
most
critical
time
of
his
life
if
you
had
only
sent
him
to
westminster
as
well
as
myself
instead
of
sending
him
to
mr
pratt
s
all
this
would
have
been
prevented
this
is
the
way
in
which
i
always
consider
the
matter
and
my
mother
is
perfectly
convinced
of
her
error
elinor
would
not
oppose
his
opinion
because
whatever
might
be
her
general
estimation
of
the
advantage
of
a
public
school
she
could
not
think
of
edward
s
abode
in
mr
pratt
s
family
with
any
satisfaction
you
reside
in
devonshire
i
think
was
his
next
observation
in
a
cottage
near
dawlish
elinor
set
him
right
as
to
its
situation
and
it
seemed
rather
surprising
to
him
that
anybody
could
live
in
devonshire
without
living
near
dawlish
he
bestowed
his
hearty
approbation
however
on
their
species
of
house
for
my
own
part
said
he
i
am
excessively
fond
of
a
cottage
there
is
always
so
much
comfort
so
much
elegance
about
them
and
i
protest
if
i
had
any
money
to
spare
i
should
buy
a
little
land
and
build
one
myself
within
a
short
distance
of
london
where
i
might
drive
myself
down
at
any
time
and
collect
a
few
friends
about
me
and
be
happy
i
advise
every
body
who
is
going
to
build
to
build
a
cottage
my
friend
lord
courtland
came
to
me
the
other
day
on
purpose
to
ask
my
advice
and
laid
before
me
three
different
plans
of
bonomi
s
i
was
to
decide
on
the
best
of
them
my
dear
courtland
said
i
immediately
throwing
them
all
into
the
fire
do
not
adopt
either
of
them
but
by
all
means
build
a
cottage
and
that
i
fancy
will
be
the
end
of
it
some
people
imagine
that
there
can
be
no
accommodations
no
space
in
a
cottage
but
this
is
all
a
mistake
i
was
last
month
at
my
friend
elliott
s
near
dartford
lady
elliott
wished
to
give
a
dance
but
how
can
it
be
done
said
she
my
dear
ferrars
do
tell
me
how
it
is
to
be
managed
there
is
not
a
room
in
this
cottage
that
will
hold
ten
couple
and
where
can
the
supper
be
i
immediately
saw
that
there
could
be
no
difficulty
in
it
so
i
said
my
dear
lady
elliott
do
not
be
uneasy
the
dining
parlour
will
admit
eighteen
couple
with
ease
card
tables
may
be
placed
in
the
drawing
room
the
library
may
be
open
for
tea
and
other
refreshments
and
let
the
supper
be
set
out
in
the
saloon
lady
elliott
was
delighted
with
the
thought
we
measured
the
dining
room
and
found
it
would
hold
exactly
eighteen
couple
and
the
affair
was
arranged
precisely
after
my
plan
so
that
in
fact
you
see
if
people
do
but
know
how
to
set
about
it
every
comfort
may
be
as
well
enjoyed
in
a
cottage
as
in
the
most
spacious
dwelling
elinor
agreed
to
it
all
for
she
did
not
think
he
deserved
the
compliment
of
rational
opposition
as
john
dashwood
had
no
more
pleasure
in
music
than
his
eldest
sister
his
mind
was
equally
at
liberty
to
fix
on
any
thing
else
and
a
thought
struck
him
during
the
evening
which
he
communicated
to
his
wife
for
her
approbation
when
they
got
home
the
consideration
of
mrs
dennison
s
mistake
in
supposing
his
sisters
their
guests
had
suggested
the
propriety
of
their
being
really
invited
to
become
such
while
mrs
jennings
s
engagements
kept
her
from
home
the
expense
would
be
nothing
the
inconvenience
not
more
and
it
was
altogether
an
attention
which
the
delicacy
of
his
conscience
pointed
out
to
be
requisite
to
its
complete
enfranchisement
from
his
promise
to
his
father
fanny
was
startled
at
the
proposal
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
done
said
she
without
affronting
lady
middleton
for
they
spend
every
day
with
her
otherwise
i
should
be
exceedingly
glad
to
do
it
you
know
i
am
always
ready
to
pay
them
any
attention
in
my
power
as
my
taking
them
out
this
evening
shews
but
they
are
lady
middleton
s
visitors
how
can
i
ask
them
away
from
her
her
husband
but
with
great
humility
did
not
see
the
force
of
her
objection
they
had
already
spent
a
week
in
this
manner
in
conduit
street
and
lady
middleton
could
not
be
displeased
at
their
giving
the
same
number
of
days
to
such
near
relations
fanny
paused
a
moment
and
then
with
fresh
vigor
said
my
love
i
would
ask
them
with
all
my
heart
if
it
was
in
my
power
but
i
had
just
settled
within
myself
to
ask
the
miss
steeles
to
spend
a
few
days
with
us
they
are
very
well
behaved
good
kind
of
girls
and
i
think
the
attention
is
due
to
them
as
their
uncle
did
so
very
well
by
edward
we
can
ask
your
sisters
some
other
year
you
know
but
the
miss
steeles
may
not
be
in
town
any
more
i
am
sure
you
will
like
them
indeed
you
do
like
them
you
know
very
much
already
and
so
does
my
mother
and
they
are
such
favourites
with
harry
mr
dashwood
was
convinced
he
saw
the
necessity
of
inviting
the
miss
steeles
immediately
and
his
conscience
was
pacified
by
the
resolution
of
inviting
his
sisters
another
year
at
the
same
time
however
slyly
suspecting
that
another
year
would
make
the
invitation
needless
by
bringing
elinor
to
town
as
colonel
brandon
s
wife
and
marianne
as
their
visitor
fanny
rejoicing
in
her
escape
and
proud
of
the
ready
wit
that
had
procured
it
wrote
the
next
morning
to
lucy
to
request
her
company
and
her
sister
s
for
some
days
in
harley
street
as
soon
as
lady
middleton
could
spare
them
this
was
enough
to
make
lucy
really
and
reasonably
happy
mrs
dashwood
seemed
actually
working
for
her
herself
cherishing
all
her
hopes
and
promoting
all
her
views
such
an
opportunity
of
being
with
edward
and
his
family
was
above
all
things
the
most
material
to
her
interest
and
such
an
invitation
the
most
gratifying
to
her
feelings
it
was
an
advantage
that
could
not
be
too
gratefully
acknowledged
nor
too
speedily
made
use
of
and
the
visit
to
lady
middleton
which
had
not
before
had
any
precise
limits
was
instantly
discovered
to
have
been
always
meant
to
end
in
two
days
time
when
the
note
was
shown
to
elinor
as
it
was
within
ten
minutes
after
its
arrival
it
gave
her
for
the
first
time
some
share
in
the
expectations
of
lucy
for
such
a
mark
of
uncommon
kindness
vouchsafed
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
seemed
to
declare
that
the
good
will
towards
her
arose
from
something
more
than
merely
malice
against
herself
and
might
be
brought
by
time
and
address
to
do
every
thing
that
lucy
wished
her
flattery
had
already
subdued
the
pride
of
lady
middleton
and
made
an
entry
into
the
close
heart
of
mrs
john
dashwood
and
these
were
effects
that
laid
open
the
probability
of
greater
the
miss
steeles
removed
to
harley
street
and
all
that
reached
elinor
of
their
influence
there
strengthened
her
expectation
of
the
event
sir
john
who
called
on
them
more
than
once
brought
home
such
accounts
of
the
favour
they
were
in
as
must
be
universally
striking
mrs
dashwood
had
never
been
so
much
pleased
with
any
young
women
in
her
life
as
she
was
with
them
had
given
each
of
them
a
needle
book
made
by
some
emigrant
called
lucy
by
her
christian
name
and
did
not
know
whether
she
should
ever
be
able
to
part
with
them
mrs
palmer
was
so
well
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
that
her
mother
felt
it
no
longer
necessary
to
give
up
the
whole
of
her
time
to
her
and
contenting
herself
with
visiting
her
once
or
twice
a
day
returned
from
that
period
to
her
own
home
and
her
own
habits
in
which
she
found
the
miss
dashwoods
very
ready
to
resume
their
former
share
about
the
third
or
fourth
morning
after
their
being
thus
resettled
in
berkeley
street
mrs
jennings
on
returning
from
her
ordinary
visit
to
mrs
palmer
entered
the
drawing
room
where
elinor
was
sitting
by
herself
with
an
air
of
such
hurrying
importance
as
prepared
her
to
hear
something
wonderful
and
giving
her
time
only
to
form
that
idea
began
directly
to
justify
it
by
saying
lord
my
dear
miss
dashwood
have
you
heard
the
news
no
ma
am
what
is
it
something
so
strange
but
you
shall
hear
it
all
when
i
got
to
mr
palmer
s
i
found
charlotte
quite
in
a
fuss
about
the
child
she
was
sure
it
was
very
ill
it
cried
and
fretted
and
was
all
over
pimples
so
i
looked
at
it
directly
and
lord
my
dear
says
i
it
is
nothing
in
the
world
but
the
red
gum
and
nurse
said
just
the
same
but
charlotte
she
would
not
be
satisfied
so
mr
donavan
was
sent
for
and
luckily
he
happened
to
just
come
in
from
harley
street
so
he
stepped
over
directly
and
as
soon
as
ever
mama
he
said
just
as
we
did
that
it
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
the
red
gum
and
then
charlotte
was
easy
and
so
just
as
he
was
going
away
again
it
came
into
my
head
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
how
i
happened
to
think
of
it
but
it
came
into
my
head
to
ask
him
if
there
was
any
news
so
upon
that
he
smirked
and
simpered
and
looked
grave
and
seemed
to
know
something
or
other
and
at
last
he
said
in
a
whisper
for
fear
any
unpleasant
report
should
reach
the
young
ladies
under
your
care
as
to
their
sister
s
indisposition
i
think
it
advisable
to
say
that
i
believe
there
is
no
great
reason
for
alarm
i
hope
mrs
dashwood
will
do
very
well
what
is
fanny
ill
that
is
exactly
what
i
said
my
dear
lord
says
i
is
mrs
dashwood
ill
so
then
it
all
came
out
and
the
long
and
the
short
of
the
matter
by
all
i
can
learn
seems
to
be
this
mr
edward
ferrars
the
very
young
man
i
used
to
joke
with
you
about
but
however
as
it
turns
out
i
am
monstrous
glad
there
was
never
any
thing
in
it
mr
edward
ferrars
it
seems
has
been
engaged
above
this
twelvemonth
to
my
cousin
lucy
there
s
for
you
my
dear
and
not
a
creature
knowing
a
syllable
of
the
matter
except
nancy
could
you
have
believed
such
a
thing
possible
there
is
no
great
wonder
in
their
liking
one
another
but
that
matters
should
be
brought
so
forward
between
them
and
nobody
suspect
it
that
is
strange
i
never
happened
to
see
them
together
or
i
am
sure
i
should
have
found
it
out
directly
well
and
so
this
was
kept
a
great
secret
for
fear
of
mrs
ferrars
and
neither
she
nor
your
brother
or
sister
suspected
a
word
of
the
matter
till
this
very
morning
poor
nancy
who
you
know
is
a
well
meaning
creature
but
no
conjurer
popt
it
all
out
lord
thinks
she
to
herself
they
are
all
so
fond
of
lucy
to
be
sure
they
will
make
no
difficulty
about
it
and
so
away
she
went
to
your
sister
who
was
sitting
all
alone
at
her
carpet
work
little
suspecting
what
was
to
come
for
she
had
just
been
saying
to
your
brother
only
five
minutes
before
that
she
thought
to
make
a
match
between
edward
and
some
lord
s
daughter
or
other
i
forget
who
so
you
may
think
what
a
blow
it
was
to
all
her
vanity
and
pride
she
fell
into
violent
hysterics
immediately
with
such
screams
as
reached
your
brother
s
ears
as
he
was
sitting
in
his
own
dressing
room
down
stairs
thinking
about
writing
a
letter
to
his
steward
in
the
country
so
up
he
flew
directly
and
a
terrible
scene
took
place
for
lucy
was
come
to
them
by
that
time
little
dreaming
what
was
going
on
poor
soul
i
pity
her
and
i
must
say
i
think
she
was
used
very
hardly
for
your
sister
scolded
like
any
fury
and
soon
drove
her
into
a
fainting
fit
nancy
she
fell
upon
her
knees
and
cried
bitterly
and
your
brother
he
walked
about
the
room
and
said
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
mrs
dashwood
declared
they
should
not
stay
a
minute
longer
in
the
house
and
your
brother
was
forced
to
go
down
upon
his
knees
too
to
persuade
her
to
let
them
stay
till
they
had
packed
up
their
clothes
then
she
fell
into
hysterics
again
and
he
was
so
frightened
that
he
would
send
for
mr
donavan
and
mr
donavan
found
the
house
in
all
this
uproar
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
ready
to
take
my
poor
cousins
away
and
they
were
just
stepping
in
as
he
came
off
poor
lucy
in
such
a
condition
he
says
she
could
hardly
walk
and
nancy
she
was
almost
as
bad
i
declare
i
have
no
patience
with
your
sister
and
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
it
will
be
a
match
in
spite
of
her
lord
what
a
taking
poor
mr
edward
will
be
in
when
he
hears
of
it
to
have
his
love
used
so
scornfully
for
they
say
he
is
monstrous
fond
of
her
as
well
he
may
i
should
not
wonder
if
he
was
to
be
in
the
greatest
passion
and
mr
donavan
thinks
just
the
same
he
and
i
had
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
it
and
the
best
of
all
is
that
he
is
gone
back
again
to
harley
street
that
he
may
be
within
call
when
mrs
ferrars
is
told
of
it
for
she
was
sent
for
as
soon
as
ever
my
cousins
left
the
house
for
your
sister
was
sure
she
would
be
in
hysterics
too
and
so
she
may
for
what
i
care
i
have
no
pity
for
either
of
them
i
have
no
notion
of
people
s
making
such
a
to
do
about
money
and
greatness
there
is
no
reason
on
earth
why
mr
edward
and
lucy
should
not
marry
for
i
am
sure
mrs
ferrars
may
afford
to
do
very
well
by
her
son
and
though
lucy
has
next
to
nothing
herself
she
knows
better
than
any
body
how
to
make
the
most
of
every
thing
i
dare
say
if
mrs
ferrars
would
only
allow
him
five
hundred
a
year
she
would
make
as
good
an
appearance
with
it
as
any
body
else
would
with
eight
lord
how
snug
they
might
live
in
such
another
cottage
as
yours
or
a
little
bigger
with
two
maids
and
two
men
and
i
believe
i
could
help
them
to
a
housemaid
for
my
betty
has
a
sister
out
of
place
that
would
fit
them
exactly
here
mrs
jennings
ceased
and
as
elinor
had
had
time
enough
to
collect
her
thoughts
she
was
able
to
give
such
an
answer
and
make
such
observations
as
the
subject
might
naturally
be
supposed
to
produce
happy
to
find
that
she
was
not
suspected
of
any
extraordinary
interest
in
it
that
mrs
jennings
as
she
had
of
late
often
hoped
might
be
the
case
had
ceased
to
imagine
her
at
all
attached
to
edward
and
happy
above
all
the
rest
in
the
absence
of
marianne
she
felt
very
well
able
to
speak
of
the
affair
without
embarrassment
and
to
give
her
judgment
as
she
believed
with
impartiality
on
the
conduct
of
every
one
concerned
in
it
she
could
hardly
determine
what
her
own
expectation
of
its
event
really
was
though
she
earnestly
tried
to
drive
away
the
notion
of
its
being
possible
to
end
otherwise
at
last
than
in
the
marriage
of
edward
and
lucy
what
mrs
ferrars
would
say
and
do
though
there
could
not
be
a
doubt
of
its
nature
she
was
anxious
to
hear
and
still
more
anxious
to
know
how
edward
would
conduct
himself
for
him
she
felt
much
compassion
for
lucy
very
little
and
it
cost
her
some
pains
to
procure
that
little
for
the
rest
of
the
party
none
at
all
as
mrs
jennings
could
talk
on
no
other
subject
elinor
soon
saw
the
necessity
of
preparing
marianne
for
its
discussion
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
undeceiving
her
in
making
her
acquainted
with
the
real
truth
and
in
endeavouring
to
bring
her
to
hear
it
talked
of
by
others
without
betraying
that
she
felt
any
uneasiness
for
her
sister
or
any
resentment
against
edward
elinor
s
office
was
a
painful
one
she
was
going
to
remove
what
she
really
believed
to
be
her
sister
s
chief
consolation
to
give
such
particulars
of
edward
as
she
feared
would
ruin
him
for
ever
in
her
good
opinion
and
to
make
marianne
by
a
resemblance
in
their
situations
which
to
her
fancy
would
seem
strong
feel
all
her
own
disappointment
over
again
but
unwelcome
as
such
a
task
must
be
it
was
necessary
to
be
done
and
elinor
therefore
hastened
to
perform
it
she
was
very
far
from
wishing
to
dwell
on
her
own
feelings
or
to
represent
herself
as
suffering
much
any
otherwise
than
as
the
self
command
she
had
practised
since
her
first
knowledge
of
edward
s
engagement
might
suggest
a
hint
of
what
was
practicable
to
marianne
her
narration
was
clear
and
simple
and
though
it
could
not
be
given
without
emotion
it
was
not
accompanied
by
violent
agitation
nor
impetuous
grief
that
belonged
rather
to
the
hearer
for
marianne
listened
with
horror
and
cried
excessively
elinor
was
to
be
the
comforter
of
others
in
her
own
distresses
no
less
than
in
theirs
and
all
the
comfort
that
could
be
given
by
assurances
of
her
own
composure
of
mind
and
a
very
earnest
vindication
of
edward
from
every
charge
but
of
imprudence
was
readily
offered
but
marianne
for
some
time
would
give
credit
to
neither
edward
seemed
a
second
willoughby
and
acknowledging
as
elinor
did
that
she
had
loved
him
most
sincerely
could
she
feel
less
than
herself
as
for
lucy
steele
she
considered
her
so
totally
unamiable
so
absolutely
incapable
of
attaching
a
sensible
man
that
she
could
not
be
persuaded
at
first
to
believe
and
afterwards
to
pardon
any
former
affection
of
edward
for
her
she
would
not
even
admit
it
to
have
been
natural
and
elinor
left
her
to
be
convinced
that
it
was
so
by
that
which
only
could
convince
her
a
better
knowledge
of
mankind
her
first
communication
had
reached
no
farther
than
to
state
the
fact
of
the
engagement
and
the
length
of
time
it
had
existed
marianne
s
feelings
had
then
broken
in
and
put
an
end
to
all
regularity
of
detail
and
for
some
time
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
soothe
her
distress
lessen
her
alarms
and
combat
her
resentment
the
first
question
on
her
side
which
led
to
farther
particulars
was
how
long
has
this
been
known
to
you
elinor
has
he
written
to
you
i
have
known
it
these
four
months
when
lucy
first
came
to
barton
park
last
november
she
told
me
in
confidence
of
her
engagement
at
these
words
marianne
s
eyes
expressed
the
astonishment
which
her
lips
could
not
utter
after
a
pause
of
wonder
she
exclaimed
four
months
have
you
known
of
this
four
months
elinor
confirmed
it
what
while
attending
me
in
all
my
misery
has
this
been
on
your
heart
and
i
have
reproached
you
for
being
happy
it
was
not
fit
that
you
should
then
know
how
much
i
was
the
reverse
four
months
cried
marianne
again
so
calm
so
cheerful
how
have
you
been
supported
by
feeling
that
i
was
doing
my
duty
my
promise
to
lucy
obliged
me
to
be
secret
i
owed
it
to
her
therefore
to
avoid
giving
any
hint
of
the
truth
and
i
owed
it
to
my
family
and
friends
not
to
create
in
them
a
solicitude
about
me
which
it
could
not
be
in
my
power
to
satisfy
marianne
seemed
much
struck
i
have
very
often
wished
to
undeceive
yourself
and
my
mother
added
elinor
and
once
or
twice
i
have
attempted
it
but
without
betraying
my
trust
i
never
could
have
convinced
you
four
months
and
yet
you
loved
him
yes
but
i
did
not
love
only
him
and
while
the
comfort
of
others
was
dear
to
me
i
was
glad
to
spare
them
from
knowing
how
much
i
felt
now
i
can
think
and
speak
of
it
with
little
emotion
i
would
not
have
you
suffer
on
my
account
for
i
assure
you
i
no
longer
suffer
materially
myself
i
have
many
things
to
support
me
i
am
not
conscious
of
having
provoked
the
disappointment
by
any
imprudence
of
my
own
i
have
borne
it
as
much
as
possible
without
spreading
it
farther
i
acquit
edward
of
essential
misconduct
i
wish
him
very
happy
and
i
am
so
sure
of
his
always
doing
his
duty
that
though
now
he
may
harbour
some
regret
in
the
end
he
must
become
so
lucy
does
not
want
sense
and
that
is
the
foundation
on
which
every
thing
good
may
be
built
and
after
all
marianne
after
all
that
is
bewitching
in
the
idea
of
a
single
and
constant
attachment
and
all
that
can
be
said
of
one
s
happiness
depending
entirely
on
any
particular
person
it
is
not
meant
it
is
not
fit
it
is
not
possible
that
it
should
be
so
edward
will
marry
lucy
he
will
marry
a
woman
superior
in
person
and
understanding
to
half
her
sex
and
time
and
habit
will
teach
him
to
forget
that
he
ever
thought
another
superior
to
her
if
such
is
your
way
of
thinking
said
marianne
if
the
loss
of
what
is
most
valued
is
so
easily
to
be
made
up
by
something
else
your
resolution
your
self
command
are
perhaps
a
little
less
to
be
wondered
at
they
are
brought
more
within
my
comprehension
i
understand
you
you
do
not
suppose
that
i
have
ever
felt
much
for
four
months
marianne
i
have
had
all
this
hanging
on
my
mind
without
being
at
liberty
to
speak
of
it
to
a
single
creature
knowing
that
it
would
make
you
and
my
mother
most
unhappy
whenever
it
were
explained
to
you
yet
unable
to
prepare
you
for
it
in
the
least
it
was
told
me
it
was
in
a
manner
forced
on
me
by
the
very
person
herself
whose
prior
engagement
ruined
all
my
prospects
and
told
me
as
i
thought
with
triumph
this
person
s
suspicions
therefore
i
have
had
to
oppose
by
endeavouring
to
appear
indifferent
where
i
have
been
most
deeply
interested
and
it
has
not
been
only
once
i
have
had
her
hopes
and
exultation
to
listen
to
again
and
again
i
have
known
myself
to
be
divided
from
edward
for
ever
without
hearing
one
circumstance
that
could
make
me
less
desire
the
connection
nothing
has
proved
him
unworthy
nor
has
anything
declared
him
indifferent
to
me
i
have
had
to
contend
against
the
unkindness
of
his
sister
and
the
insolence
of
his
mother
and
have
suffered
the
punishment
of
an
attachment
without
enjoying
its
advantages
and
all
this
has
been
going
on
at
a
time
when
as
you
know
too
well
it
has
not
been
my
only
unhappiness
if
you
can
think
me
capable
of
ever
feeling
surely
you
may
suppose
that
i
have
suffered
now
the
composure
of
mind
with
which
i
have
brought
myself
at
present
to
consider
the
matter
the
consolation
that
i
have
been
willing
to
admit
have
been
the
effect
of
constant
and
painful
exertion
they
did
not
spring
up
of
themselves
they
did
not
occur
to
relieve
my
spirits
at
first
no
marianne
then
if
i
had
not
been
bound
to
silence
perhaps
nothing
could
have
kept
me
entirely
not
even
what
i
owed
to
my
dearest
friends
from
openly
shewing
that
i
was
very
unhappy
marianne
was
quite
subdued
oh
elinor
she
cried
you
have
made
me
hate
myself
for
ever
how
barbarous
have
i
been
to
you
you
who
have
been
my
only
comfort
who
have
borne
with
me
in
all
my
misery
who
have
seemed
to
be
only
suffering
for
me
is
this
my
gratitude
is
this
the
only
return
i
can
make
you
because
your
merit
cries
out
upon
myself
i
have
been
trying
to
do
it
away
the
tenderest
caresses
followed
this
confession
in
such
a
frame
of
mind
as
she
was
now
in
elinor
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
from
her
whatever
promise
she
required
and
at
her
request
marianne
engaged
never
to
speak
of
the
affair
to
any
one
with
the
least
appearance
of
bitterness
to
meet
lucy
without
betraying
the
smallest
increase
of
dislike
to
her
and
even
to
see
edward
himself
if
chance
should
bring
them
together
without
any
diminution
of
her
usual
cordiality
these
were
great
concessions
but
where
marianne
felt
that
she
had
injured
no
reparation
could
be
too
much
for
her
to
make
she
performed
her
promise
of
being
discreet
to
admiration
she
attended
to
all
that
mrs
jennings
had
to
say
upon
the
subject
with
an
unchanging
complexion
dissented
from
her
in
nothing
and
was
heard
three
times
to
say
yes
ma
am
she
listened
to
her
praise
of
lucy
with
only
moving
from
one
chair
to
another
and
when
mrs
jennings
talked
of
edward
s
affection
it
cost
her
only
a
spasm
in
her
throat
such
advances
towards
heroism
in
her
sister
made
elinor
feel
equal
to
any
thing
herself
the
next
morning
brought
a
farther
trial
of
it
in
a
visit
from
their
brother
who
came
with
a
most
serious
aspect
to
talk
over
the
dreadful
affair
and
bring
them
news
of
his
wife
you
have
heard
i
suppose
said
he
with
great
solemnity
as
soon
as
he
was
seated
of
the
very
shocking
discovery
that
took
place
under
our
roof
yesterday
they
all
looked
their
assent
it
seemed
too
awful
a
moment
for
speech
your
sister
he
continued
has
suffered
dreadfully
mrs
ferrars
too
in
short
it
has
been
a
scene
of
such
complicated
distress
but
i
will
hope
that
the
storm
may
be
weathered
without
our
being
any
of
us
quite
overcome
poor
fanny
she
was
in
hysterics
all
yesterday
but
i
would
not
alarm
you
too
much
donavan
says
there
is
nothing
materially
to
be
apprehended
her
constitution
is
a
good
one
and
her
resolution
equal
to
any
thing
she
has
borne
it
all
with
the
fortitude
of
an
angel
she
says
she
never
shall
think
well
of
anybody
again
and
one
cannot
wonder
at
it
after
being
so
deceived
meeting
with
such
ingratitude
where
so
much
kindness
had
been
shewn
so
much
confidence
had
been
placed
it
was
quite
out
of
the
benevolence
of
her
heart
that
she
had
asked
these
young
women
to
her
house
merely
because
she
thought
they
deserved
some
attention
were
harmless
well
behaved
girls
and
would
be
pleasant
companions
for
otherwise
we
both
wished
very
much
to
have
invited
you
and
marianne
to
be
with
us
while
your
kind
friend
there
was
attending
her
daughter
and
now
to
be
so
rewarded
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
says
poor
fanny
in
her
affectionate
way
that
we
had
asked
your
sisters
instead
of
them
here
he
stopped
to
be
thanked
which
being
done
he
went
on
what
poor
mrs
ferrars
suffered
when
first
fanny
broke
it
to
her
is
not
to
be
described
while
she
with
the
truest
affection
had
been
planning
a
most
eligible
connection
for
him
was
it
to
be
supposed
that
he
could
be
all
the
time
secretly
engaged
to
another
person
such
a
suspicion
could
never
have
entered
her
head
if
she
suspected
any
prepossession
elsewhere
it
could
not
be
in
that
quarter
there
to
be
sure
said
she
i
might
have
thought
myself
safe
she
was
quite
in
an
agony
we
consulted
together
however
as
to
what
should
be
done
and
at
last
she
determined
to
send
for
edward
he
came
but
i
am
sorry
to
relate
what
ensued
all
that
mrs
ferrars
could
say
to
make
him
put
an
end
to
the
engagement
assisted
too
as
you
may
well
suppose
by
my
arguments
and
fanny
s
entreaties
was
of
no
avail
duty
affection
every
thing
was
disregarded
i
never
thought
edward
so
stubborn
so
unfeeling
before
his
mother
explained
to
him
her
liberal
designs
in
case
of
his
marrying
miss
morton
told
him
she
would
settle
on
him
the
norfolk
estate
which
clear
of
land
tax
brings
in
a
good
thousand
a
year
offered
even
when
matters
grew
desperate
to
make
it
twelve
hundred
and
in
opposition
to
this
if
he
still
persisted
in
this
low
connection
represented
to
him
the
certain
penury
that
must
attend
the
match
his
own
two
thousand
pounds
she
protested
should
be
his
all
she
would
never
see
him
again
and
so
far
would
she
be
from
affording
him
the
smallest
assistance
that
if
he
were
to
enter
into
any
profession
with
a
view
of
better
support
she
would
do
all
in
her
power
to
prevent
him
advancing
in
it
here
marianne
in
an
ecstasy
of
indignation
clapped
her
hands
together
and
cried
gracious
god
can
this
be
possible
well
may
you
wonder
marianne
replied
her
brother
at
the
obstinacy
which
could
resist
such
arguments
as
these
your
exclamation
is
very
natural
marianne
was
going
to
retort
but
she
remembered
her
promises
and
forbore
all
this
however
he
continued
was
urged
in
vain
edward
said
very
little
but
what
he
did
say
was
in
the
most
determined
manner
nothing
should
prevail
on
him
to
give
up
his
engagement
he
would
stand
to
it
cost
him
what
it
might
then
cried
mrs
jennings
with
blunt
sincerity
no
longer
able
to
be
silent
he
has
acted
like
an
honest
man
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
dashwood
but
if
he
had
done
otherwise
i
should
have
thought
him
a
rascal
i
have
some
little
concern
in
the
business
as
well
as
yourself
for
lucy
steele
is
my
cousin
and
i
believe
there
is
not
a
better
kind
of
girl
in
the
world
nor
one
who
more
deserves
a
good
husband
john
dashwood
was
greatly
astonished
but
his
nature
was
calm
not
open
to
provocation
and
he
never
wished
to
offend
anybody
especially
anybody
of
good
fortune
he
therefore
replied
without
any
resentment
i
would
by
no
means
speak
disrespectfully
of
any
relation
of
yours
madam
miss
lucy
steele
is
i
dare
say
a
very
deserving
young
woman
but
in
the
present
case
you
know
the
connection
must
be
impossible
and
to
have
entered
into
a
secret
engagement
with
a
young
man
under
her
uncle
s
care
the
son
of
a
woman
especially
of
such
very
large
fortune
as
mrs
ferrars
is
perhaps
altogether
a
little
extraordinary
in
short
i
do
not
mean
to
reflect
upon
the
behaviour
of
any
person
whom
you
have
a
regard
for
mrs
jennings
we
all
wish
her
extremely
happy
and
mrs
ferrars
s
conduct
throughout
the
whole
has
been
such
as
every
conscientious
good
mother
in
like
circumstances
would
adopt
it
has
been
dignified
and
liberal
edward
has
drawn
his
own
lot
and
i
fear
it
will
be
a
bad
one
marianne
sighed
out
her
similar
apprehension
and
elinor
s
heart
wrung
for
the
feelings
of
edward
while
braving
his
mother
s
threats
for
a
woman
who
could
not
reward
him
well
sir
said
mrs
jennings
and
how
did
it
end
i
am
sorry
to
say
ma
am
in
a
most
unhappy
rupture
edward
is
dismissed
for
ever
from
his
mother
s
notice
he
left
her
house
yesterday
but
where
he
is
gone
or
whether
he
is
still
in
town
i
do
not
know
for
we
of
course
can
make
no
inquiry
poor
young
man
and
what
is
to
become
of
him
what
indeed
ma
am
it
is
a
melancholy
consideration
born
to
the
prospect
of
such
affluence
i
cannot
conceive
a
situation
more
deplorable
the
interest
of
two
thousand
pounds
how
can
a
man
live
on
it
and
when
to
that
is
added
the
recollection
that
he
might
but
for
his
own
folly
within
three
months
have
been
in
the
receipt
of
two
thousand
five
hundred
a
year
for
miss
morton
has
thirty
thousand
pounds
i
cannot
picture
to
myself
a
more
wretched
condition
we
must
all
feel
for
him
and
the
more
so
because
it
is
totally
out
of
our
power
to
assist
him
poor
young
man
cried
mrs
jennings
i
am
sure
he
should
be
very
welcome
to
bed
and
board
at
my
house
and
so
i
would
tell
him
if
i
could
see
him
it
is
not
fit
that
he
should
be
living
about
at
his
own
charge
now
at
lodgings
and
taverns
elinor
s
heart
thanked
her
for
such
kindness
towards
edward
though
she
could
not
forbear
smiling
at
the
form
of
it
if
he
would
only
have
done
as
well
by
himself
said
john
dashwood
as
all
his
friends
were
disposed
to
do
by
him
he
might
now
have
been
in
his
proper
situation
and
would
have
wanted
for
nothing
but
as
it
is
it
must
be
out
of
anybody
s
power
to
assist
him
and
there
is
one
thing
more
preparing
against
him
which
must
be
worse
than
all
his
mother
has
determined
with
a
very
natural
kind
of
spirit
to
settle
that
estate
upon
robert
immediately
which
might
have
been
edward
s
on
proper
conditions
i
left
her
this
morning
with
her
lawyer
talking
over
the
business
well
said
mrs
jennings
that
is
her
revenge
everybody
has
a
way
of
their
own
but
i
don
t
think
mine
would
be
to
make
one
son
independent
because
another
had
plagued
me
marianne
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
can
anything
be
more
galling
to
the
spirit
of
a
man
continued
john
than
to
see
his
younger
brother
in
possession
of
an
estate
which
might
have
been
his
own
poor
edward
i
feel
for
him
sincerely
a
few
minutes
more
spent
in
the
same
kind
of
effusion
concluded
his
visit
and
with
repeated
assurances
to
his
sisters
that
he
really
believed
there
was
no
material
danger
in
fanny
s
indisposition
and
that
they
need
not
therefore
be
very
uneasy
about
it
he
went
away
leaving
the
three
ladies
unanimous
in
their
sentiments
on
the
present
occasion
as
far
at
least
as
it
regarded
mrs
ferrars
s
conduct
the
dashwoods
and
edward
s
marianne
s
indignation
burst
forth
as
soon
as
he
quitted
the
room
and
as
her
vehemence
made
reserve
impossible
in
elinor
and
unnecessary
in
mrs
jennings
they
all
joined
in
a
very
spirited
critique
upon
the
party
mrs
jennings
was
very
warm
in
her
praise
of
edward
s
conduct
but
only
elinor
and
marianne
understood
its
true
merit
they
only
knew
how
little
he
had
had
to
tempt
him
to
be
disobedient
and
how
small
was
the
consolation
beyond
the
consciousness
of
doing
right
that
could
remain
to
him
in
the
loss
of
friends
and
fortune
elinor
gloried
in
his
integrity
and
marianne
forgave
all
his
offences
in
compassion
for
his
punishment
but
though
confidence
between
them
was
by
this
public
discovery
restored
to
its
proper
state
it
was
not
a
subject
on
which
either
of
them
were
fond
of
dwelling
when
alone
elinor
avoided
it
upon
principle
as
tending
to
fix
still
more
upon
her
thoughts
by
the
too
warm
too
positive
assurances
of
marianne
that
belief
of
edward
s
continued
affection
for
herself
which
she
rather
wished
to
do
away
and
marianne
s
courage
soon
failed
her
in
trying
to
converse
upon
a
topic
which
always
left
her
more
dissatisfied
with
herself
than
ever
by
the
comparison
it
necessarily
produced
between
elinor
s
conduct
and
her
own
she
felt
all
the
force
of
that
comparison
but
not
as
her
sister
had
hoped
to
urge
her
to
exertion
now
she
felt
it
with
all
the
pain
of
continual
self
reproach
regretted
most
bitterly
that
she
had
never
exerted
herself
before
but
it
brought
only
the
torture
of
penitence
without
the
hope
of
amendment
her
mind
was
so
much
weakened
that
she
still
fancied
present
exertion
impossible
and
therefore
it
only
dispirited
her
more
nothing
new
was
heard
by
them
for
a
day
or
two
afterwards
of
affairs
in
harley
street
or
bartlett
s
buildings
but
though
so
much
of
the
matter
was
known
to
them
already
that
mrs
jennings
might
have
had
enough
to
do
in
spreading
that
knowledge
farther
without
seeking
after
more
she
had
resolved
from
the
first
to
pay
a
visit
of
comfort
and
inquiry
to
her
cousins
as
soon
as
she
could
and
nothing
but
the
hindrance
of
more
visitors
than
usual
had
prevented
her
going
to
them
within
that
time
the
third
day
succeeding
their
knowledge
of
the
particulars
was
so
fine
so
beautiful
a
sunday
as
to
draw
many
to
kensington
gardens
though
it
was
only
the
second
week
in
march
mrs
jennings
and
elinor
were
of
the
number
but
marianne
who
knew
that
the
willoughbys
were
again
in
town
and
had
a
constant
dread
of
meeting
them
chose
rather
to
stay
at
home
than
venture
into
so
public
a
place
an
intimate
acquaintance
of
mrs
jennings
joined
them
soon
after
they
entered
the
gardens
and
elinor
was
not
sorry
that
by
her
continuing
with
them
and
engaging
all
mrs
jennings
s
conversation
she
was
herself
left
to
quiet
reflection
she
saw
nothing
of
the
willoughbys
nothing
of
edward
and
for
some
time
nothing
of
anybody
who
could
by
any
chance
whether
grave
or
gay
be
interesting
to
her
but
at
last
she
found
herself
with
some
surprise
accosted
by
miss
steele
who
though
looking
rather
shy
expressed
great
satisfaction
in
meeting
them
and
on
receiving
encouragement
from
the
particular
kindness
of
mrs
jennings
left
her
own
party
for
a
short
time
to
join
their
s
mrs
jennings
immediately
whispered
to
elinor
get
it
all
out
of
her
my
dear
she
will
tell
you
any
thing
if
you
ask
you
see
i
cannot
leave
mrs
clarke
it
was
lucky
however
for
mrs
jennings
s
curiosity
and
elinor
s
too
that
she
would
tell
any
thing
without
being
asked
for
nothing
would
otherwise
have
been
learnt
i
am
so
glad
to
meet
you
said
miss
steele
taking
her
familiarly
by
the
arm
for
i
wanted
to
see
you
of
all
things
in
the
world
and
then
lowering
her
voice
i
suppose
mrs
jennings
has
heard
all
about
it
is
she
angry
not
at
all
i
believe
with
you
that
is
a
good
thing
and
lady
middleton
is
she
angry
i
cannot
suppose
it
possible
that
she
should
be
i
am
monstrous
glad
of
it
good
gracious
i
have
had
such
a
time
of
it
i
never
saw
lucy
in
such
a
rage
in
my
life
she
vowed
at
first
she
would
never
trim
me
up
a
new
bonnet
nor
do
any
thing
else
for
me
again
so
long
as
she
lived
but
now
she
is
quite
come
to
and
we
are
as
good
friends
as
ever
look
she
made
me
this
bow
to
my
hat
and
put
in
the
feather
last
night
there
now
you
are
going
to
laugh
at
me
too
but
why
should
not
i
wear
pink
ribbons
i
do
not
care
if
it
is
the
doctor
s
favourite
colour
i
am
sure
for
my
part
i
should
never
have
known
he
did
like
it
better
than
any
other
colour
if
he
had
not
happened
to
say
so
my
cousins
have
been
so
plaguing
me
i
declare
sometimes
i
do
not
know
which
way
to
look
before
them
she
had
wandered
away
to
a
subject
on
which
elinor
had
nothing
to
say
and
therefore
soon
judged
it
expedient
to
find
her
way
back
again
to
the
first
well
but
miss
dashwood
speaking
triumphantly
people
may
say
what
they
chuse
about
mr
ferrars
s
declaring
he
would
not
have
lucy
for
it
is
no
such
thing
i
can
tell
you
and
it
is
quite
a
shame
for
such
ill
natured
reports
to
be
spread
abroad
whatever
lucy
might
think
about
it
herself
you
know
it
was
no
business
of
other
people
to
set
it
down
for
certain
i
never
heard
any
thing
of
the
kind
hinted
at
before
i
assure
you
said
elinor
oh
did
not
you
but
it
was
said
i
know
very
well
and
by
more
than
one
for
miss
godby
told
miss
sparks
that
nobody
in
their
senses
could
expect
mr
ferrars
to
give
up
a
woman
like
miss
morton
with
thirty
thousand
pounds
to
her
fortune
for
lucy
steele
that
had
nothing
at
all
and
i
had
it
from
miss
sparks
myself
and
besides
that
my
cousin
richard
said
himself
that
when
it
came
to
the
point
he
was
afraid
mr
ferrars
would
be
off
and
when
edward
did
not
come
near
us
for
three
days
i
could
not
tell
what
to
think
myself
and
i
believe
in
my
heart
lucy
gave
it
up
all
for
lost
for
we
came
away
from
your
brother
s
wednesday
and
we
saw
nothing
of
him
not
all
thursday
friday
and
saturday
and
did
not
know
what
was
become
of
him
once
lucy
thought
to
write
to
him
but
then
her
spirits
rose
against
that
however
this
morning
he
came
just
as
we
came
home
from
church
and
then
it
all
came
out
how
he
had
been
sent
for
wednesday
to
harley
street
and
been
talked
to
by
his
mother
and
all
of
them
and
how
he
had
declared
before
them
all
that
he
loved
nobody
but
lucy
and
nobody
but
lucy
would
he
have
and
how
he
had
been
so
worried
by
what
passed
that
as
soon
as
he
had
went
away
from
his
mother
s
house
he
had
got
upon
his
horse
and
rid
into
the
country
some
where
or
other
and
how
he
had
stayed
about
at
an
inn
all
thursday
and
friday
on
purpose
to
get
the
better
of
it
and
after
thinking
it
all
over
and
over
again
he
said
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
now
he
had
no
fortune
and
no
nothing
at
all
it
would
be
quite
unkind
to
keep
her
on
to
the
engagement
because
it
must
be
for
her
loss
for
he
had
nothing
but
two
thousand
pounds
and
no
hope
of
any
thing
else
and
if
he
was
to
go
into
orders
as
he
had
some
thoughts
he
could
get
nothing
but
a
curacy
and
how
was
they
to
live
upon
that
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
her
doing
no
better
and
so
he
begged
if
she
had
the
least
mind
for
it
to
put
an
end
to
the
matter
directly
and
leave
him
shift
for
himself
i
heard
him
say
all
this
as
plain
as
could
possibly
be
and
it
was
entirely
for
her
sake
and
upon
her
account
that
he
said
a
word
about
being
off
and
not
upon
his
own
i
will
take
my
oath
he
never
dropt
a
syllable
of
being
tired
of
her
or
of
wishing
to
marry
miss
morton
or
any
thing
like
it
but
to
be
sure
lucy
would
not
give
ear
to
such
kind
of
talking
so
she
told
him
directly
with
a
great
deal
about
sweet
and
love
you
know
and
all
that
oh
la
one
can
t
repeat
such
kind
of
things
you
know
she
told
him
directly
she
had
not
the
least
mind
in
the
world
to
be
off
for
she
could
live
with
him
upon
a
trifle
and
how
little
so
ever
he
might
have
she
should
be
very
glad
to
have
it
all
you
know
or
something
of
the
kind
so
then
he
was
monstrous
happy
and
talked
on
some
time
about
what
they
should
do
and
they
agreed
he
should
take
orders
directly
and
they
must
wait
to
be
married
till
he
got
a
living
and
just
then
i
could
not
hear
any
more
for
my
cousin
called
from
below
to
tell
me
mrs
richardson
was
come
in
her
coach
and
would
take
one
of
us
to
kensington
gardens
so
i
was
forced
to
go
into
the
room
and
interrupt
them
to
ask
lucy
if
she
would
like
to
go
but
she
did
not
care
to
leave
edward
so
i
just
run
up
stairs
and
put
on
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
and
came
off
with
the
richardsons
i
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
by
interrupting
them
said
elinor
you
were
all
in
the
same
room
together
were
not
you
no
indeed
not
us
la
miss
dashwood
do
you
think
people
make
love
when
any
body
else
is
by
oh
for
shame
to
be
sure
you
must
know
better
than
that
laughing
affectedly
no
no
they
were
shut
up
in
the
drawing
room
together
and
all
i
heard
was
only
by
listening
at
the
door
how
cried
elinor
have
you
been
repeating
to
me
what
you
only
learnt
yourself
by
listening
at
the
door
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
know
it
before
for
i
certainly
would
not
have
suffered
you
to
give
me
particulars
of
a
conversation
which
you
ought
not
to
have
known
yourself
how
could
you
behave
so
unfairly
by
your
sister
oh
la
there
is
nothing
in
that
i
only
stood
at
the
door
and
heard
what
i
could
and
i
am
sure
lucy
would
have
done
just
the
same
by
me
for
a
year
or
two
back
when
martha
sharpe
and
i
had
so
many
secrets
together
she
never
made
any
bones
of
hiding
in
a
closet
or
behind
a
chimney
board
on
purpose
to
hear
what
we
said
elinor
tried
to
talk
of
something
else
but
miss
steele
could
not
be
kept
beyond
a
couple
of
minutes
from
what
was
uppermost
in
her
mind
edward
talks
of
going
to
oxford
soon
said
she
but
now
he
is
lodging
at
no
pall
mall
what
an
ill
natured
woman
his
mother
is
an
t
she
and
your
brother
and
sister
were
not
very
kind
however
i
shan
t
say
anything
against
them
to
you
and
to
be
sure
they
did
send
us
home
in
their
own
chariot
which
was
more
than
i
looked
for
and
for
my
part
i
was
all
in
a
fright
for
fear
your
sister
should
ask
us
for
the
huswifes
she
had
gave
us
a
day
or
two
before
but
however
nothing
was
said
about
them
and
i
took
care
to
keep
mine
out
of
sight
edward
have
got
some
business
at
oxford
he
says
so
he
must
go
there
for
a
time
and
after
that
as
soon
as
he
can
light
upon
a
bishop
he
will
be
ordained
i
wonder
what
curacy
he
will
get
good
gracious
giggling
as
she
spoke
i
d
lay
my
life
i
know
what
my
cousins
will
say
when
they
hear
of
it
they
will
tell
me
i
should
write
to
the
doctor
to
get
edward
the
curacy
of
his
new
living
i
know
they
will
but
i
am
sure
i
would
not
do
such
a
thing
for
all
the
world
la
i
shall
say
directly
i
wonder
how
you
could
think
of
such
a
thing
i
write
to
the
doctor
indeed
well
said
elinor
it
is
a
comfort
to
be
prepared
against
the
worst
you
have
got
your
answer
ready
miss
steele
was
going
to
reply
on
the
same
subject
but
the
approach
of
her
own
party
made
another
more
necessary
oh
la
here
come
the
richardsons
i
had
a
vast
deal
more
to
say
to
you
but
i
must
not
stay
away
from
them
not
any
longer
i
assure
you
they
are
very
genteel
people
he
makes
a
monstrous
deal
of
money
and
they
keep
their
own
coach
i
have
not
time
to
speak
to
mrs
jennings
about
it
myself
but
pray
tell
her
i
am
quite
happy
to
hear
she
is
not
in
anger
against
us
and
lady
middleton
the
same
and
if
anything
should
happen
to
take
you
and
your
sister
away
and
mrs
jennings
should
want
company
i
am
sure
we
should
be
very
glad
to
come
and
stay
with
her
for
as
long
a
time
as
she
likes
i
suppose
lady
middleton
won
t
ask
us
any
more
this
bout
good
by
i
am
sorry
miss
marianne
was
not
here
remember
me
kindly
to
her
la
if
you
have
not
got
your
spotted
muslin
on
i
wonder
you
was
not
afraid
of
its
being
torn
such
was
her
parting
concern
for
after
this
she
had
time
only
to
pay
her
farewell
compliments
to
mrs
jennings
before
her
company
was
claimed
by
mrs
richardson
and
elinor
was
left
in
possession
of
knowledge
which
might
feed
her
powers
of
reflection
some
time
though
she
had
learnt
very
little
more
than
what
had
been
already
foreseen
and
foreplanned
in
her
own
mind
edward
s
marriage
with
lucy
was
as
firmly
determined
on
and
the
time
of
its
taking
place
remained
as
absolutely
uncertain
as
she
had
concluded
it
would
be
every
thing
depended
exactly
after
her
expectation
on
his
getting
that
preferment
of
which
at
present
there
seemed
not
the
smallest
chance
as
soon
as
they
returned
to
the
carriage
mrs
jennings
was
eager
for
information
but
as
elinor
wished
to
spread
as
little
as
possible
intelligence
that
had
in
the
first
place
been
so
unfairly
obtained
she
confined
herself
to
the
brief
repetition
of
such
simple
particulars
as
she
felt
assured
that
lucy
for
the
sake
of
her
own
consequence
would
choose
to
have
known
the
continuance
of
their
engagement
and
the
means
that
were
able
to
be
taken
for
promoting
its
end
was
all
her
communication
and
this
produced
from
mrs
jennings
the
following
natural
remark
wait
for
his
having
a
living
ay
we
all
know
how
that
will
end
they
will
wait
a
twelvemonth
and
finding
no
good
comes
of
it
will
set
down
upon
a
curacy
of
fifty
pounds
a
year
with
the
interest
of
his
two
thousand
pounds
and
what
little
matter
mr
steele
and
mr
pratt
can
give
her
then
they
will
have
a
child
every
year
and
lord
help
em
how
poor
they
will
be
i
must
see
what
i
can
give
them
towards
furnishing
their
house
two
maids
and
two
men
indeed
as
i
talked
of
t
other
day
no
no
they
must
get
a
stout
girl
of
all
works
betty
s
sister
would
never
do
for
them
now
the
next
morning
brought
elinor
a
letter
by
the
two
penny
post
from
lucy
herself
it
was
as
follows
bartlett
s
building
march
i
hope
my
dear
miss
dashwood
will
excuse
the
liberty
i
take
of
writing
to
her
but
i
know
your
friendship
for
me
will
make
you
pleased
to
hear
such
a
good
account
of
myself
and
my
dear
edward
after
all
the
troubles
we
have
went
through
lately
therefore
will
make
no
more
apologies
but
proceed
to
say
that
thank
god
though
we
have
suffered
dreadfully
we
are
both
quite
well
now
and
as
happy
as
we
must
always
be
in
one
another
s
love
we
have
had
great
trials
and
great
persecutions
but
however
at
the
same
time
gratefully
acknowledge
many
friends
yourself
not
the
least
among
them
whose
great
kindness
i
shall
always
thankfully
remember
as
will
edward
too
who
i
have
told
of
it
i
am
sure
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
as
likewise
dear
mrs
jennings
i
spent
two
happy
hours
with
him
yesterday
afternoon
he
would
not
hear
of
our
parting
though
earnestly
did
i
as
i
thought
my
duty
required
urge
him
to
it
for
prudence
sake
and
would
have
parted
for
ever
on
the
spot
would
he
consent
to
it
but
he
said
it
should
never
be
he
did
not
regard
his
mother
s
anger
while
he
could
have
my
affections
our
prospects
are
not
very
bright
to
be
sure
but
we
must
wait
and
hope
for
the
best
he
will
be
ordained
shortly
and
should
it
ever
be
in
your
power
to
recommend
him
to
any
body
that
has
a
living
to
bestow
am
very
sure
you
will
not
forget
us
and
dear
mrs
jennings
too
trust
she
will
speak
a
good
word
for
us
to
sir
john
or
mr
palmer
or
any
friend
that
may
be
able
to
assist
us
poor
anne
was
much
to
blame
for
what
she
did
but
she
did
it
for
the
best
so
i
say
nothing
hope
mrs
jennings
won
t
think
it
too
much
trouble
to
give
us
a
call
should
she
come
this
way
any
morning
twould
be
a
great
kindness
and
my
cousins
would
be
proud
to
know
her
my
paper
reminds
me
to
conclude
and
begging
to
be
most
gratefully
and
respectfully
remembered
to
her
and
to
sir
john
and
lady
middleton
and
the
dear
children
when
you
chance
to
see
them
and
love
to
miss
marianne
i
am
c
as
soon
as
elinor
had
finished
it
she
performed
what
she
concluded
to
be
its
writer
s
real
design
by
placing
it
in
the
hands
of
mrs
jennings
who
read
it
aloud
with
many
comments
of
satisfaction
and
praise
very
well
indeed
how
prettily
she
writes
aye
that
was
quite
proper
to
let
him
be
off
if
he
would
that
was
just
like
lucy
poor
soul
i
wish
i
could
get
him
a
living
with
all
my
heart
she
calls
me
dear
mrs
jennings
you
see
she
is
a
good
hearted
girl
as
ever
lived
very
well
upon
my
word
that
sentence
is
very
prettily
turned
yes
yes
i
will
go
and
see
her
sure
enough
how
attentive
she
is
to
think
of
every
body
thank
you
my
dear
for
shewing
it
me
it
is
as
pretty
a
letter
as
ever
i
saw
and
does
lucy
s
head
and
heart
great
credit
the
miss
dashwoods
had
now
been
rather
more
than
two
months
in
town
and
marianne
s
impatience
to
be
gone
increased
every
day
she
sighed
for
the
air
the
liberty
the
quiet
of
the
country
and
fancied
that
if
any
place
could
give
her
ease
barton
must
do
it
elinor
was
hardly
less
anxious
than
herself
for
their
removal
and
only
so
much
less
bent
on
its
being
effected
immediately
as
that
she
was
conscious
of
the
difficulties
of
so
long
a
journey
which
marianne
could
not
be
brought
to
acknowledge
she
began
however
seriously
to
turn
her
thoughts
towards
its
accomplishment
and
had
already
mentioned
their
wishes
to
their
kind
hostess
who
resisted
them
with
all
the
eloquence
of
her
good
will
when
a
plan
was
suggested
which
though
detaining
them
from
home
yet
a
few
weeks
longer
appeared
to
elinor
altogether
much
more
eligible
than
any
other
the
palmers
were
to
remove
to
cleveland
about
the
end
of
march
for
the
easter
holidays
and
mrs
jennings
with
both
her
friends
received
a
very
warm
invitation
from
charlotte
to
go
with
them
this
would
not
in
itself
have
been
sufficient
for
the
delicacy
of
miss
dashwood
but
it
was
inforced
with
so
much
real
politeness
by
mr
palmer
himself
as
joined
to
the
very
great
amendment
of
his
manners
towards
them
since
her
sister
had
been
known
to
be
unhappy
induced
her
to
accept
it
with
pleasure
when
she
told
marianne
what
she
had
done
however
her
first
reply
was
not
very
auspicious
cleveland
she
cried
with
great
agitation
no
i
cannot
go
to
cleveland
you
forget
said
elinor
gently
that
its
situation
is
not
that
it
is
not
in
the
neighbourhood
of
but
it
is
in
somersetshire
i
cannot
go
into
somersetshire
there
where
i
looked
forward
to
going
no
elinor
you
cannot
expect
me
to
go
there
elinor
would
not
argue
upon
the
propriety
of
overcoming
such
feelings
she
only
endeavoured
to
counteract
them
by
working
on
others
represented
it
therefore
as
a
measure
which
would
fix
the
time
of
her
returning
to
that
dear
mother
whom
she
so
much
wished
to
see
in
a
more
eligible
more
comfortable
manner
than
any
other
plan
could
do
and
perhaps
without
any
greater
delay
from
cleveland
which
was
within
a
few
miles
of
bristol
the
distance
to
barton
was
not
beyond
one
day
though
a
long
day
s
journey
and
their
mother
s
servant
might
easily
come
there
to
attend
them
down
and
as
there
could
be
no
occasion
of
their
staying
above
a
week
at
cleveland
they
might
now
be
at
home
in
little
more
than
three
weeks
time
as
marianne
s
affection
for
her
mother
was
sincere
it
must
triumph
with
little
difficulty
over
the
imaginary
evils
she
had
started
mrs
jennings
was
so
far
from
being
weary
of
her
guests
that
she
pressed
them
very
earnestly
to
return
with
her
again
from
cleveland
elinor
was
grateful
for
the
attention
but
it
could
not
alter
her
design
and
their
mother
s
concurrence
being
readily
gained
every
thing
relative
to
their
return
was
arranged
as
far
as
it
could
be
and
marianne
found
some
relief
in
drawing
up
a
statement
of
the
hours
that
were
yet
to
divide
her
from
barton
ah
colonel
i
do
not
know
what
you
and
i
shall
do
without
the
miss
dashwoods
was
mrs
jennings
s
address
to
him
when
he
first
called
on
her
after
their
leaving
her
was
settled
for
they
are
quite
resolved
upon
going
home
from
the
palmers
and
how
forlorn
we
shall
be
when
i
come
back
lord
we
shall
sit
and
gape
at
one
another
as
dull
as
two
cats
perhaps
mrs
jennings
was
in
hopes
by
this
vigorous
sketch
of
their
future
ennui
to
provoke
him
to
make
that
offer
which
might
give
himself
an
escape
from
it
and
if
so
she
had
soon
afterwards
good
reason
to
think
her
object
gained
for
on
elinor
s
moving
to
the
window
to
take
more
expeditiously
the
dimensions
of
a
print
which
she
was
going
to
copy
for
her
friend
he
followed
her
to
it
with
a
look
of
particular
meaning
and
conversed
with
her
there
for
several
minutes
the
effect
of
his
discourse
on
the
lady
too
could
not
escape
her
observation
for
though
she
was
too
honorable
to
listen
and
had
even
changed
her
seat
on
purpose
that
she
might
not
hear
to
one
close
by
the
piano
forte
on
which
marianne
was
playing
she
could
not
keep
herself
from
seeing
that
elinor
changed
colour
attended
with
agitation
and
was
too
intent
on
what
he
said
to
pursue
her
employment
still
farther
in
confirmation
of
her
hopes
in
the
interval
of
marianne
s
turning
from
one
lesson
to
another
some
words
of
the
colonel
s
inevitably
reached
her
ear
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
apologising
for
the
badness
of
his
house
this
set
the
matter
beyond
a
doubt
she
wondered
indeed
at
his
thinking
it
necessary
to
do
so
but
supposed
it
to
be
the
proper
etiquette
what
elinor
said
in
reply
she
could
not
distinguish
but
judged
from
the
motion
of
her
lips
that
she
did
not
think
that
any
material
objection
and
mrs
jennings
commended
her
in
her
heart
for
being
so
honest
they
then
talked
on
for
a
few
minutes
longer
without
her
catching
a
syllable
when
another
lucky
stop
in
marianne
s
performance
brought
her
these
words
in
the
colonel
s
calm
voice
i
am
afraid
it
cannot
take
place
very
soon
astonished
and
shocked
at
so
unlover
like
a
speech
she
was
almost
ready
to
cry
out
lord
what
should
hinder
it
but
checking
her
desire
confined
herself
to
this
silent
ejaculation
this
is
very
strange
sure
he
need
not
wait
to
be
older
this
delay
on
the
colonel
s
side
however
did
not
seem
to
offend
or
mortify
his
fair
companion
in
the
least
for
on
their
breaking
up
the
conference
soon
afterwards
and
moving
different
ways
mrs
jennings
very
plainly
heard
elinor
say
and
with
a
voice
which
shewed
her
to
feel
what
she
said
i
shall
always
think
myself
very
much
obliged
to
you
mrs
jennings
was
delighted
with
her
gratitude
and
only
wondered
that
after
hearing
such
a
sentence
the
colonel
should
be
able
to
take
leave
of
them
as
he
immediately
did
with
the
utmost
sang
froid
and
go
away
without
making
her
any
reply
she
had
not
thought
her
old
friend
could
have
made
so
indifferent
a
suitor
what
had
really
passed
between
them
was
to
this
effect
i
have
heard
said
he
with
great
compassion
of
the
injustice
your
friend
mr
ferrars
has
suffered
from
his
family
for
if
i
understand
the
matter
right
he
has
been
entirely
cast
off
by
them
for
persevering
in
his
engagement
with
a
very
deserving
young
woman
have
i
been
rightly
informed
is
it
so
elinor
told
him
that
it
was
the
cruelty
the
impolitic
cruelty
he
replied
with
great
feeling
of
dividing
or
attempting
to
divide
two
young
people
long
attached
to
each
other
is
terrible
mrs
ferrars
does
not
know
what
she
may
be
doing
what
she
may
drive
her
son
to
i
have
seen
mr
ferrars
two
or
three
times
in
harley
street
and
am
much
pleased
with
him
he
is
not
a
young
man
with
whom
one
can
be
intimately
acquainted
in
a
short
time
but
i
have
seen
enough
of
him
to
wish
him
well
for
his
own
sake
and
as
a
friend
of
yours
i
wish
it
still
more
i
understand
that
he
intends
to
take
orders
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
him
that
the
living
of
delaford
now
just
vacant
as
i
am
informed
by
this
day
s
post
is
his
if
he
think
it
worth
his
acceptance
but
that
perhaps
so
unfortunately
circumstanced
as
he
is
now
it
may
be
nonsense
to
appear
to
doubt
i
only
wish
it
were
more
valuable
it
is
a
rectory
but
a
small
one
the
late
incumbent
i
believe
did
not
make
more
than
l
per
annum
and
though
it
is
certainly
capable
of
improvement
i
fear
not
to
such
an
amount
as
to
afford
him
a
very
comfortable
income
such
as
it
is
however
my
pleasure
in
presenting
it
to
him
will
be
very
great
pray
assure
him
of
it
elinor
s
astonishment
at
this
commission
could
hardly
have
been
greater
had
the
colonel
been
really
making
her
an
offer
of
his
hand
the
preferment
which
only
two
days
before
she
had
considered
as
hopeless
for
edward
was
already
provided
to
enable
him
to
marry
and
she
of
all
people
in
the
world
was
fixed
on
to
bestow
it
her
emotion
was
such
as
mrs
jennings
had
attributed
to
a
very
different
cause
but
whatever
minor
feelings
less
pure
less
pleasing
might
have
a
share
in
that
emotion
her
esteem
for
the
general
benevolence
and
her
gratitude
for
the
particular
friendship
which
together
prompted
colonel
brandon
to
this
act
were
strongly
felt
and
warmly
expressed
she
thanked
him
for
it
with
all
her
heart
spoke
of
edward
s
principles
and
disposition
with
that
praise
which
she
knew
them
to
deserve
and
promised
to
undertake
the
commission
with
pleasure
if
it
were
really
his
wish
to
put
off
so
agreeable
an
office
to
another
but
at
the
same
time
she
could
not
help
thinking
that
no
one
could
so
well
perform
it
as
himself
it
was
an
office
in
short
from
which
unwilling
to
give
edward
the
pain
of
receiving
an
obligation
from
her
she
would
have
been
very
glad
to
be
spared
herself
but
colonel
brandon
on
motives
of
equal
delicacy
declining
it
likewise
still
seemed
so
desirous
of
its
being
given
through
her
means
that
she
would
not
on
any
account
make
farther
opposition
edward
she
believed
was
still
in
town
and
fortunately
she
had
heard
his
address
from
miss
steele
she
could
undertake
therefore
to
inform
him
of
it
in
the
course
of
the
day
after
this
had
been
settled
colonel
brandon
began
to
talk
of
his
own
advantage
in
securing
so
respectable
and
agreeable
a
neighbour
and
then
it
was
that
he
mentioned
with
regret
that
the
house
was
small
and
indifferent
an
evil
which
elinor
as
mrs
jennings
had
supposed
her
to
do
made
very
light
of
at
least
as
far
as
regarded
its
size
the
smallness
of
the
house
said
she
i
cannot
imagine
any
inconvenience
to
them
for
it
will
be
in
proportion
to
their
family
and
income
by
which
the
colonel
was
surprised
to
find
that
she
was
considering
mr
ferrars
s
marriage
as
the
certain
consequence
of
the
presentation
for
he
did
not
suppose
it
possible
that
delaford
living
could
supply
such
an
income
as
anybody
in
his
style
of
life
would
venture
to
settle
on
and
he
said
so
this
little
rectory
can
do
no
more
than
make
mr
ferrars
comfortable
as
a
bachelor
it
cannot
enable
him
to
marry
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
my
patronage
ends
with
this
and
my
interest
is
hardly
more
extensive
if
however
by
an
unforeseen
chance
it
should
be
in
my
power
to
serve
him
farther
i
must
think
very
differently
of
him
from
what
i
now
do
if
i
am
not
as
ready
to
be
useful
to
him
then
as
i
sincerely
wish
i
could
be
at
present
what
i
am
now
doing
indeed
seems
nothing
at
all
since
it
can
advance
him
so
little
towards
what
must
be
his
principal
his
only
object
of
happiness
his
marriage
must
still
be
a
distant
good
at
least
i
am
afraid
it
cannot
take
place
very
soon
such
was
the
sentence
which
when
misunderstood
so
justly
offended
the
delicate
feelings
of
mrs
jennings
but
after
this
narration
of
what
really
passed
between
colonel
brandon
and
elinor
while
they
stood
at
the
window
the
gratitude
expressed
by
the
latter
on
their
parting
may
perhaps
appear
in
general
not
less
reasonably
excited
nor
less
properly
worded
than
if
it
had
arisen
from
an
offer
of
marriage
well
miss
dashwood
said
mrs
jennings
sagaciously
smiling
as
soon
as
the
gentleman
had
withdrawn
i
do
not
ask
you
what
the
colonel
has
been
saying
to
you
for
though
upon
my
honour
i
tried
to
keep
out
of
hearing
i
could
not
help
catching
enough
to
understand
his
business
and
i
assure
you
i
never
was
better
pleased
in
my
life
and
i
wish
you
joy
of
it
with
all
my
heart
thank
you
ma
am
said
elinor
it
is
a
matter
of
great
joy
to
me
and
i
feel
the
goodness
of
colonel
brandon
most
sensibly
there
are
not
many
men
who
would
act
as
he
has
done
few
people
who
have
so
compassionate
a
heart
i
never
was
more
astonished
in
my
life
lord
my
dear
you
are
very
modest
i
an
t
the
least
astonished
at
it
in
the
world
for
i
have
often
thought
of
late
there
was
nothing
more
likely
to
happen
you
judged
from
your
knowledge
of
the
colonel
s
general
benevolence
but
at
least
you
could
not
foresee
that
the
opportunity
would
so
very
soon
occur
opportunity
repeated
mrs
jennings
oh
as
to
that
when
a
man
has
once
made
up
his
mind
to
such
a
thing
somehow
or
other
he
will
soon
find
an
opportunity
well
my
dear
i
wish
you
joy
of
it
again
and
again
and
if
ever
there
was
a
happy
couple
in
the
world
i
think
i
shall
soon
know
where
to
look
for
them
you
mean
to
go
to
delaford
after
them
i
suppose
said
elinor
with
a
faint
smile
aye
my
dear
that
i
do
indeed
and
as
to
the
house
being
a
bad
one
i
do
not
know
what
the
colonel
would
be
at
for
it
is
as
good
a
one
as
ever
i
saw
he
spoke
of
its
being
out
of
repair
well
and
whose
fault
is
that
why
don
t
he
repair
it
who
should
do
it
but
himself
they
were
interrupted
by
the
servant
s
coming
in
to
announce
the
carriage
being
at
the
door
and
mrs
jennings
immediately
preparing
to
go
said
well
my
dear
i
must
be
gone
before
i
have
had
half
my
talk
out
but
however
we
may
have
it
all
over
in
the
evening
for
we
shall
be
quite
alone
i
do
not
ask
you
to
go
with
me
for
i
dare
say
your
mind
is
too
full
of
the
matter
to
care
for
company
and
besides
you
must
long
to
tell
your
sister
all
about
it
marianne
had
left
the
room
before
the
conversation
began
certainly
ma
am
i
shall
tell
marianne
of
it
but
i
shall
not
mention
it
at
present
to
any
body
else
oh
very
well
said
mrs
jennings
rather
disappointed
then
you
would
not
have
me
tell
it
to
lucy
for
i
think
of
going
as
far
as
holborn
to
day
no
ma
am
not
even
lucy
if
you
please
one
day
s
delay
will
not
be
very
material
and
till
i
have
written
to
mr
ferrars
i
think
it
ought
not
to
be
mentioned
to
any
body
else
i
shall
do
that
directly
it
is
of
importance
that
no
time
should
be
lost
with
him
for
he
will
of
course
have
much
to
do
relative
to
his
ordination
this
speech
at
first
puzzled
mrs
jennings
exceedingly
why
mr
ferrars
was
to
have
been
written
to
about
it
in
such
a
hurry
she
could
not
immediately
comprehend
a
few
moments
reflection
however
produced
a
very
happy
idea
and
she
exclaimed
oh
ho
i
understand
you
mr
ferrars
is
to
be
the
man
well
so
much
the
better
for
him
ay
to
be
sure
he
must
be
ordained
in
readiness
and
i
am
very
glad
to
find
things
are
so
forward
between
you
but
my
dear
is
not
this
rather
out
of
character
should
not
the
colonel
write
himself
sure
he
is
the
proper
person
elinor
did
not
quite
understand
the
beginning
of
mrs
jennings
s
speech
neither
did
she
think
it
worth
inquiring
into
and
therefore
only
replied
to
its
conclusion
colonel
brandon
is
so
delicate
a
man
that
he
rather
wished
any
one
to
announce
his
intentions
to
mr
ferrars
than
himself
and
so
you
are
forced
to
do
it
well
that
is
an
odd
kind
of
delicacy
however
i
will
not
disturb
you
seeing
her
preparing
to
write
you
know
your
own
concerns
best
so
goodby
my
dear
i
have
not
heard
of
any
thing
to
please
me
so
well
since
charlotte
was
brought
to
bed
and
away
she
went
but
returning
again
in
a
moment
i
have
just
been
thinking
of
betty
s
sister
my
dear
i
should
be
very
glad
to
get
her
so
good
a
mistress
but
whether
she
would
do
for
a
lady
s
maid
i
am
sure
i
can
t
tell
she
is
an
excellent
housemaid
and
works
very
well
at
her
needle
however
you
will
think
of
all
that
at
your
leisure
certainly
ma
am
replied
elinor
not
hearing
much
of
what
she
said
and
more
anxious
to
be
alone
than
to
be
mistress
of
the
subject
how
she
should
begin
how
she
should
express
herself
in
her
note
to
edward
was
now
all
her
concern
the
particular
circumstances
between
them
made
a
difficulty
of
that
which
to
any
other
person
would
have
been
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
but
she
equally
feared
to
say
too
much
or
too
little
and
sat
deliberating
over
her
paper
with
the
pen
in
her
hand
till
broken
in
on
by
the
entrance
of
edward
himself
he
had
met
mrs
jennings
at
the
door
in
her
way
to
the
carriage
as
he
came
to
leave
his
farewell
card
and
she
after
apologising
for
not
returning
herself
had
obliged
him
to
enter
by
saying
that
miss
dashwood
was
above
and
wanted
to
speak
with
him
on
very
particular
business
elinor
had
just
been
congratulating
herself
in
the
midst
of
her
perplexity
that
however
difficult
it
might
be
to
express
herself
properly
by
letter
it
was
at
least
preferable
to
giving
the
information
by
word
of
mouth
when
her
visitor
entered
to
force
her
upon
this
greatest
exertion
of
all
her
astonishment
and
confusion
were
very
great
on
his
so
sudden
appearance
she
had
not
seen
him
before
since
his
engagement
became
public
and
therefore
not
since
his
knowing
her
to
be
acquainted
with
it
which
with
the
consciousness
of
what
she
had
been
thinking
of
and
what
she
had
to
tell
him
made
her
feel
particularly
uncomfortable
for
some
minutes
he
too
was
much
distressed
and
they
sat
down
together
in
a
most
promising
state
of
embarrassment
whether
he
had
asked
her
pardon
for
his
intrusion
on
first
coming
into
the
room
he
could
not
recollect
but
determining
to
be
on
the
safe
side
he
made
his
apology
in
form
as
soon
as
he
could
say
any
thing
after
taking
a
chair
mrs
jennings
told
me
said
he
that
you
wished
to
speak
with
me
at
least
i
understood
her
so
or
i
certainly
should
not
have
intruded
on
you
in
such
a
manner
though
at
the
same
time
i
should
have
been
extremely
sorry
to
leave
london
without
seeing
you
and
your
sister
especially
as
it
will
most
likely
be
some
time
it
is
not
probable
that
i
should
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
again
i
go
to
oxford
tomorrow
you
would
not
have
gone
however
said
elinor
recovering
herself
and
determined
to
get
over
what
she
so
much
dreaded
as
soon
as
possible
without
receiving
our
good
wishes
even
if
we
had
not
been
able
to
give
them
in
person
mrs
jennings
was
quite
right
in
what
she
said
i
have
something
of
consequence
to
inform
you
of
which
i
was
on
the
point
of
communicating
by
paper
i
am
charged
with
a
most
agreeable
office
breathing
rather
faster
than
usual
as
she
spoke
colonel
brandon
who
was
here
only
ten
minutes
ago
has
desired
me
to
say
that
understanding
you
mean
to
take
orders
he
has
great
pleasure
in
offering
you
the
living
of
delaford
now
just
vacant
and
only
wishes
it
were
more
valuable
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
on
having
so
respectable
and
well
judging
a
friend
and
to
join
in
his
wish
that
the
living
it
is
about
two
hundred
a
year
were
much
more
considerable
and
such
as
might
better
enable
you
to
as
might
be
more
than
a
temporary
accommodation
to
yourself
such
in
short
as
might
establish
all
your
views
of
happiness
what
edward
felt
as
he
could
not
say
it
himself
it
cannot
be
expected
that
any
one
else
should
say
for
him
he
looked
all
the
astonishment
which
such
unexpected
such
unthought
of
information
could
not
fail
of
exciting
but
he
said
only
these
two
words
colonel
brandon
yes
continued
elinor
gathering
more
resolution
as
some
of
the
worst
was
over
colonel
brandon
means
it
as
a
testimony
of
his
concern
for
what
has
lately
passed
for
the
cruel
situation
in
which
the
unjustifiable
conduct
of
your
family
has
placed
you
a
concern
which
i
am
sure
marianne
myself
and
all
your
friends
must
share
and
likewise
as
a
proof
of
his
high
esteem
for
your
general
character
and
his
particular
approbation
of
your
behaviour
on
the
present
occasion
colonel
brandon
give
me
a
living
can
it
be
possible
the
unkindness
of
your
own
relations
has
made
you
astonished
to
find
friendship
any
where
no
replied
he
with
sudden
consciousness
not
to
find
it
in
you
for
i
cannot
be
ignorant
that
to
you
to
your
goodness
i
owe
it
all
i
feel
it
i
would
express
it
if
i
could
but
as
you
well
know
i
am
no
orator
you
are
very
much
mistaken
i
do
assure
you
that
you
owe
it
entirely
at
least
almost
entirely
to
your
own
merit
and
colonel
brandon
s
discernment
of
it
i
have
had
no
hand
in
it
i
did
not
even
know
till
i
understood
his
design
that
the
living
was
vacant
nor
had
it
ever
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
have
had
such
a
living
in
his
gift
as
a
friend
of
mine
of
my
family
he
may
perhaps
indeed
i
know
he
has
still
greater
pleasure
in
bestowing
it
but
upon
my
word
you
owe
nothing
to
my
solicitation
truth
obliged
her
to
acknowledge
some
small
share
in
the
action
but
she
was
at
the
same
time
so
unwilling
to
appear
as
the
benefactress
of
edward
that
she
acknowledged
it
with
hesitation
which
probably
contributed
to
fix
that
suspicion
in
his
mind
which
had
recently
entered
it
for
a
short
time
he
sat
deep
in
thought
after
elinor
had
ceased
to
speak
at
last
and
as
if
it
were
rather
an
effort
he
said
colonel
brandon
seems
a
man
of
great
worth
and
respectability
i
have
always
heard
him
spoken
of
as
such
and
your
brother
i
know
esteems
him
highly
he
is
undoubtedly
a
sensible
man
and
in
his
manners
perfectly
the
gentleman
indeed
replied
elinor
i
believe
that
you
will
find
him
on
farther
acquaintance
all
that
you
have
heard
him
to
be
and
as
you
will
be
such
very
near
neighbours
for
i
understand
the
parsonage
is
almost
close
to
the
mansion
house
it
is
particularly
important
that
he
should
be
all
this
edward
made
no
answer
but
when
she
had
turned
away
her
head
gave
her
a
look
so
serious
so
earnest
so
uncheerful
as
seemed
to
say
that
he
might
hereafter
wish
the
distance
between
the
parsonage
and
the
mansion
house
much
greater
colonel
brandon
i
think
lodges
in
st
james
street
said
he
soon
afterwards
rising
from
his
chair
elinor
told
him
the
number
of
the
house
i
must
hurry
away
then
to
give
him
those
thanks
which
you
will
not
allow
me
to
give
you
to
assure
him
that
he
has
made
me
a
very
an
exceedingly
happy
man
elinor
did
not
offer
to
detain
him
and
they
parted
with
a
very
earnest
assurance
on
her
side
of
her
unceasing
good
wishes
for
his
happiness
in
every
change
of
situation
that
might
befall
him
on
his
with
rather
an
attempt
to
return
the
same
good
will
than
the
power
of
expressing
it
when
i
see
him
again
said
elinor
to
herself
as
the
door
shut
him
out
i
shall
see
him
the
husband
of
lucy
and
with
this
pleasing
anticipation
she
sat
down
to
reconsider
the
past
recall
the
words
and
endeavour
to
comprehend
all
the
feelings
of
edward
and
of
course
to
reflect
on
her
own
with
discontent
when
mrs
jennings
came
home
though
she
returned
from
seeing
people
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
and
of
whom
therefore
she
must
have
a
great
deal
to
say
her
mind
was
so
much
more
occupied
by
the
important
secret
in
her
possession
than
by
anything
else
that
she
reverted
to
it
again
as
soon
as
elinor
appeared
well
my
dear
she
cried
i
sent
you
up
the
young
man
did
not
i
do
right
and
i
suppose
you
had
no
great
difficulty
you
did
not
find
him
very
unwilling
to
accept
your
proposal
no
ma
am
that
was
not
very
likely
well
and
how
soon
will
he
be
ready
for
it
seems
all
to
depend
upon
that
really
said
elinor
i
know
so
little
of
these
kind
of
forms
that
i
can
hardly
even
conjecture
as
to
the
time
or
the
preparation
necessary
but
i
suppose
two
or
three
months
will
complete
his
ordination
two
or
three
months
cried
mrs
jennings
lord
my
dear
how
calmly
you
talk
of
it
and
can
the
colonel
wait
two
or
three
months
lord
bless
me
i
am
sure
it
would
put
me
quite
out
of
patience
and
though
one
would
be
very
glad
to
do
a
kindness
by
poor
mr
ferrars
i
do
think
it
is
not
worth
while
to
wait
two
or
three
months
for
him
sure
somebody
else
might
be
found
that
would
do
as
well
somebody
that
is
in
orders
already
my
dear
ma
am
said
elinor
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
why
colonel
brandon
s
only
object
is
to
be
of
use
to
mr
ferrars
lord
bless
you
my
dear
sure
you
do
not
mean
to
persuade
me
that
the
colonel
only
marries
you
for
the
sake
of
giving
ten
guineas
to
mr
ferrars
the
deception
could
not
continue
after
this
and
an
explanation
immediately
took
place
by
which
both
gained
considerable
amusement
for
the
moment
without
any
material
loss
of
happiness
to
either
for
mrs
jennings
only
exchanged
one
form
of
delight
for
another
and
still
without
forfeiting
her
expectation
of
the
first
aye
aye
the
parsonage
is
but
a
small
one
said
she
after
the
first
ebullition
of
surprise
and
satisfaction
was
over
and
very
likely
may
be
out
of
repair
but
to
hear
a
man
apologising
as
i
thought
for
a
house
that
to
my
knowledge
has
five
sitting
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
and
i
think
the
housekeeper
told
me
could
make
up
fifteen
beds
and
to
you
too
that
had
been
used
to
live
in
barton
cottage
it
seems
quite
ridiculous
but
my
dear
we
must
touch
up
the
colonel
to
do
some
thing
to
the
parsonage
and
make
it
comfortable
for
them
before
lucy
goes
to
it
but
colonel
brandon
does
not
seem
to
have
any
idea
of
the
living
s
being
enough
to
allow
them
to
marry
the
colonel
is
a
ninny
my
dear
because
he
has
two
thousand
a
year
himself
he
thinks
that
nobody
else
can
marry
on
less
take
my
word
for
it
that
if
i
am
alive
i
shall
be
paying
a
visit
at
delaford
parsonage
before
michaelmas
and
i
am
sure
i
shan
t
go
if
lucy
an
t
there
elinor
was
quite
of
her
opinion
as
to
the
probability
of
their
not
waiting
for
any
thing
more
edward
having
carried
his
thanks
to
colonel
brandon
proceeded
with
his
happiness
to
lucy
and
such
was
the
excess
of
it
by
the
time
he
reached
bartlett
s
buildings
that
she
was
able
to
assure
mrs
jennings
who
called
on
her
again
the
next
day
with
her
congratulations
that
she
had
never
seen
him
in
such
spirits
before
in
her
life
her
own
happiness
and
her
own
spirits
were
at
least
very
certain
and
she
joined
mrs
jennings
most
heartily
in
her
expectation
of
their
being
all
comfortably
together
in
delaford
parsonage
before
michaelmas
so
far
was
she
at
the
same
time
from
any
backwardness
to
give
elinor
that
credit
which
edward
would
give
her
that
she
spoke
of
her
friendship
for
them
both
with
the
most
grateful
warmth
was
ready
to
own
all
their
obligation
to
her
and
openly
declared
that
no
exertion
for
their
good
on
miss
dashwood
s
part
either
present
or
future
would
ever
surprise
her
for
she
believed
her
capable
of
doing
any
thing
in
the
world
for
those
she
really
valued
as
for
colonel
brandon
she
was
not
only
ready
to
worship
him
as
a
saint
but
was
moreover
truly
anxious
that
he
should
be
treated
as
one
in
all
worldly
concerns
anxious
that
his
tithes
should
be
raised
to
the
utmost
and
scarcely
resolved
to
avail
herself
at
delaford
as
far
as
she
possibly
could
of
his
servants
his
carriage
his
cows
and
his
poultry
it
was
now
above
a
week
since
john
dashwood
had
called
in
berkeley
street
and
as
since
that
time
no
notice
had
been
taken
by
them
of
his
wife
s
indisposition
beyond
one
verbal
enquiry
elinor
began
to
feel
it
necessary
to
pay
her
a
visit
this
was
an
obligation
however
which
not
only
opposed
her
own
inclination
but
which
had
not
the
assistance
of
any
encouragement
from
her
companions
marianne
not
contented
with
absolutely
refusing
to
go
herself
was
very
urgent
to
prevent
her
sister
s
going
at
all
and
mrs
jennings
though
her
carriage
was
always
at
elinor
s
service
so
very
much
disliked
mrs
john
dashwood
that
not
even
her
curiosity
to
see
how
she
looked
after
the
late
discovery
nor
her
strong
desire
to
affront
her
by
taking
edward
s
part
could
overcome
her
unwillingness
to
be
in
her
company
again
the
consequence
was
that
elinor
set
out
by
herself
to
pay
a
visit
for
which
no
one
could
really
have
less
inclination
and
to
run
the
risk
of
a
tete
a
tete
with
a
woman
whom
neither
of
the
others
had
so
much
reason
to
dislike
mrs
dashwood
was
denied
but
before
the
carriage
could
turn
from
the
house
her
husband
accidentally
came
out
he
expressed
great
pleasure
in
meeting
elinor
told
her
that
he
had
been
just
going
to
call
in
berkeley
street
and
assuring
her
that
fanny
would
be
very
glad
to
see
her
invited
her
to
come
in
they
walked
up
stairs
in
to
the
drawing
room
nobody
was
there
fanny
is
in
her
own
room
i
suppose
said
he
i
will
go
to
her
presently
for
i
am
sure
she
will
not
have
the
least
objection
in
the
world
to
seeing
you
very
far
from
it
indeed
now
especially
there
cannot
be
but
however
you
and
marianne
were
always
great
favourites
why
would
not
marianne
come
elinor
made
what
excuse
she
could
for
her
i
am
not
sorry
to
see
you
alone
he
replied
for
i
have
a
good
deal
to
say
to
you
this
living
of
colonel
brandon
s
can
it
be
true
has
he
really
given
it
to
edward
i
heard
it
yesterday
by
chance
and
was
coming
to
you
on
purpose
to
enquire
farther
about
it
it
is
perfectly
true
colonel
brandon
has
given
the
living
of
delaford
to
edward
really
well
this
is
very
astonishing
no
relationship
no
connection
between
them
and
now
that
livings
fetch
such
a
price
what
was
the
value
of
this
about
two
hundred
a
year
very
well
and
for
the
next
presentation
to
a
living
of
that
value
supposing
the
late
incumbent
to
have
been
old
and
sickly
and
likely
to
vacate
it
soon
he
might
have
got
i
dare
say
fourteen
hundred
pounds
and
how
came
he
not
to
have
settled
that
matter
before
this
person
s
death
now
indeed
it
would
be
too
late
to
sell
it
but
a
man
of
colonel
brandon
s
sense
i
wonder
he
should
be
so
improvident
in
a
point
of
such
common
such
natural
concern
well
i
am
convinced
that
there
is
a
vast
deal
of
inconsistency
in
almost
every
human
character
i
suppose
however
on
recollection
that
the
case
may
probably
be
this
edward
is
only
to
hold
the
living
till
the
person
to
whom
the
colonel
has
really
sold
the
presentation
is
old
enough
to
take
it
aye
aye
that
is
the
fact
depend
upon
it
elinor
contradicted
it
however
very
positively
and
by
relating
that
she
had
herself
been
employed
in
conveying
the
offer
from
colonel
brandon
to
edward
and
therefore
must
understand
the
terms
on
which
it
was
given
obliged
him
to
submit
to
her
authority
it
is
truly
astonishing
he
cried
after
hearing
what
she
said
what
could
be
the
colonel
s
motive
a
very
simple
one
to
be
of
use
to
mr
ferrars
well
well
whatever
colonel
brandon
may
be
edward
is
a
very
lucky
man
you
will
not
mention
the
matter
to
fanny
however
for
though
i
have
broke
it
to
her
and
she
bears
it
vastly
well
she
will
not
like
to
hear
it
much
talked
of
elinor
had
some
difficulty
here
to
refrain
from
observing
that
she
thought
fanny
might
have
borne
with
composure
an
acquisition
of
wealth
to
her
brother
by
which
neither
she
nor
her
child
could
be
possibly
impoverished
mrs
ferrars
added
he
lowering
his
voice
to
the
tone
becoming
so
important
a
subject
knows
nothing
about
it
at
present
and
i
believe
it
will
be
best
to
keep
it
entirely
concealed
from
her
as
long
as
may
be
when
the
marriage
takes
place
i
fear
she
must
hear
of
it
all
but
why
should
such
precaution
be
used
though
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
mrs
ferrars
can
have
the
smallest
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
her
son
has
money
enough
to
live
upon
for
that
must
be
quite
out
of
the
question
yet
why
upon
her
late
behaviour
is
she
supposed
to
feel
at
all
she
has
done
with
her
son
she
cast
him
off
for
ever
and
has
made
all
those
over
whom
she
had
any
influence
cast
him
off
likewise
surely
after
doing
so
she
cannot
be
imagined
liable
to
any
impression
of
sorrow
or
of
joy
on
his
account
she
cannot
be
interested
in
any
thing
that
befalls
him
she
would
not
be
so
weak
as
to
throw
away
the
comfort
of
a
child
and
yet
retain
the
anxiety
of
a
parent
ah
elinor
said
john
your
reasoning
is
very
good
but
it
is
founded
on
ignorance
of
human
nature
when
edward
s
unhappy
match
takes
place
depend
upon
it
his
mother
will
feel
as
much
as
if
she
had
never
discarded
him
and
therefore
every
circumstance
that
may
accelerate
that
dreadful
event
must
be
concealed
from
her
as
much
as
possible
mrs
ferrars
can
never
forget
that
edward
is
her
son
you
surprise
me
i
should
think
it
must
nearly
have
escaped
her
memory
by
this
time
you
wrong
her
exceedingly
mrs
ferrars
is
one
of
the
most
affectionate
mothers
in
the
world
elinor
was
silent
we
think
now
said
mr
dashwood
after
a
short
pause
of
robert
s
marrying
miss
morton
elinor
smiling
at
the
grave
and
decisive
importance
of
her
brother
s
tone
calmly
replied
the
lady
i
suppose
has
no
choice
in
the
affair
choice
how
do
you
mean
i
only
mean
that
i
suppose
from
your
manner
of
speaking
it
must
be
the
same
to
miss
morton
whether
she
marry
edward
or
robert
certainly
there
can
be
no
difference
for
robert
will
now
to
all
intents
and
purposes
be
considered
as
the
eldest
son
and
as
to
any
thing
else
they
are
both
very
agreeable
young
men
i
do
not
know
that
one
is
superior
to
the
other
elinor
said
no
more
and
john
was
also
for
a
short
time
silent
his
reflections
ended
thus
of
one
thing
my
dear
sister
kindly
taking
her
hand
and
speaking
in
an
awful
whisper
i
may
assure
you
and
i
will
do
it
because
i
know
it
must
gratify
you
i
have
good
reason
to
think
indeed
i
have
it
from
the
best
authority
or
i
should
not
repeat
it
for
otherwise
it
would
be
very
wrong
to
say
any
thing
about
it
but
i
have
it
from
the
very
best
authority
not
that
i
ever
precisely
heard
mrs
ferrars
say
it
herself
but
her
daughter
did
and
i
have
it
from
her
that
in
short
whatever
objections
there
might
be
against
a
certain
a
certain
connection
you
understand
me
it
would
have
been
far
preferable
to
her
it
would
not
have
given
her
half
the
vexation
that
this
does
i
was
exceedingly
pleased
to
hear
that
mrs
ferrars
considered
it
in
that
light
a
very
gratifying
circumstance
you
know
to
us
all
it
would
have
been
beyond
comparison
she
said
the
least
evil
of
the
two
and
she
would
be
glad
to
compound
now
for
nothing
worse
but
however
all
that
is
quite
out
of
the
question
not
to
be
thought
of
or
mentioned
as
to
any
attachment
you
know
it
never
could
be
all
that
is
gone
by
but
i
thought
i
would
just
tell
you
of
this
because
i
knew
how
much
it
must
please
you
not
that
you
have
any
reason
to
regret
my
dear
elinor
there
is
no
doubt
of
your
doing
exceedingly
well
quite
as
well
or
better
perhaps
all
things
considered
has
colonel
brandon
been
with
you
lately
elinor
had
heard
enough
if
not
to
gratify
her
vanity
and
raise
her
self
importance
to
agitate
her
nerves
and
fill
her
mind
and
she
was
therefore
glad
to
be
spared
from
the
necessity
of
saying
much
in
reply
herself
and
from
the
danger
of
hearing
any
thing
more
from
her
brother
by
the
entrance
of
mr
robert
ferrars
after
a
few
moments
chat
john
dashwood
recollecting
that
fanny
was
yet
uninformed
of
her
sister
s
being
there
quitted
the
room
in
quest
of
her
and
elinor
was
left
to
improve
her
acquaintance
with
robert
who
by
the
gay
unconcern
the
happy
self
complacency
of
his
manner
while
enjoying
so
unfair
a
division
of
his
mother
s
love
and
liberality
to
the
prejudice
of
his
banished
brother
earned
only
by
his
own
dissipated
course
of
life
and
that
brother
s
integrity
was
confirming
her
most
unfavourable
opinion
of
his
head
and
heart
they
had
scarcely
been
two
minutes
by
themselves
before
he
began
to
speak
of
edward
for
he
too
had
heard
of
the
living
and
was
very
inquisitive
on
the
subject
elinor
repeated
the
particulars
of
it
as
she
had
given
them
to
john
and
their
effect
on
robert
though
very
different
was
not
less
striking
than
it
had
been
on
him
he
laughed
most
immoderately
the
idea
of
edward
s
being
a
clergyman
and
living
in
a
small
parsonage
house
diverted
him
beyond
measure
and
when
to
that
was
added
the
fanciful
imagery
of
edward
reading
prayers
in
a
white
surplice
and
publishing
the
banns
of
marriage
between
john
smith
and
mary
brown
he
could
conceive
nothing
more
ridiculous
elinor
while
she
waited
in
silence
and
immovable
gravity
the
conclusion
of
such
folly
could
not
restrain
her
eyes
from
being
fixed
on
him
with
a
look
that
spoke
all
the
contempt
it
excited
it
was
a
look
however
very
well
bestowed
for
it
relieved
her
own
feelings
and
gave
no
intelligence
to
him
he
was
recalled
from
wit
to
wisdom
not
by
any
reproof
of
hers
but
by
his
own
sensibility
we
may
treat
it
as
a
joke
said
he
at
last
recovering
from
the
affected
laugh
which
had
considerably
lengthened
out
the
genuine
gaiety
of
the
moment
but
upon
my
soul
it
is
a
most
serious
business
poor
edward
he
is
ruined
for
ever
i
am
extremely
sorry
for
it
for
i
know
him
to
be
a
very
good
hearted
creature
as
well
meaning
a
fellow
perhaps
as
any
in
the
world
you
must
not
judge
of
him
miss
dashwood
from
your
slight
acquaintance
poor
edward
his
manners
are
certainly
not
the
happiest
in
nature
but
we
are
not
all
born
you
know
with
the
same
powers
the
same
address
poor
fellow
to
see
him
in
a
circle
of
strangers
to
be
sure
it
was
pitiable
enough
but
upon
my
soul
i
believe
he
has
as
good
a
heart
as
any
in
the
kingdom
and
i
declare
and
protest
to
you
i
never
was
so
shocked
in
my
life
as
when
it
all
burst
forth
i
could
not
believe
it
my
mother
was
the
first
person
who
told
me
of
it
and
i
feeling
myself
called
on
to
act
with
resolution
immediately
said
to
her
my
dear
madam
i
do
not
know
what
you
may
intend
to
do
on
the
occasion
but
as
for
myself
i
must
say
that
if
edward
does
marry
this
young
woman
i
never
will
see
him
again
that
was
what
i
said
immediately
i
was
most
uncommonly
shocked
indeed
poor
edward
he
has
done
for
himself
completely
shut
himself
out
for
ever
from
all
decent
society
but
as
i
directly
said
to
my
mother
i
am
not
in
the
least
surprised
at
it
from
his
style
of
education
it
was
always
to
be
expected
my
poor
mother
was
half
frantic
have
you
ever
seen
the
lady
yes
once
while
she
was
staying
in
this
house
i
happened
to
drop
in
for
ten
minutes
and
i
saw
quite
enough
of
her
the
merest
awkward
country
girl
without
style
or
elegance
and
almost
without
beauty
i
remember
her
perfectly
just
the
kind
of
girl
i
should
suppose
likely
to
captivate
poor
edward
i
offered
immediately
as
soon
as
my
mother
related
the
affair
to
me
to
talk
to
him
myself
and
dissuade
him
from
the
match
but
it
was
too
late
then
i
found
to
do
any
thing
for
unluckily
i
was
not
in
the
way
at
first
and
knew
nothing
of
it
till
after
the
breach
had
taken
place
when
it
was
not
for
me
you
know
to
interfere
but
had
i
been
informed
of
it
a
few
hours
earlier
i
think
it
is
most
probable
that
something
might
have
been
hit
on
i
certainly
should
have
represented
it
to
edward
in
a
very
strong
light
my
dear
fellow
i
should
have
said
consider
what
you
are
doing
you
are
making
a
most
disgraceful
connection
and
such
a
one
as
your
family
are
unanimous
in
disapproving
i
cannot
help
thinking
in
short
that
means
might
have
been
found
but
now
it
is
all
too
late
he
must
be
starved
you
know
that
is
certain
absolutely
starved
he
had
just
settled
this
point
with
great
composure
when
the
entrance
of
mrs
john
dashwood
put
an
end
to
the
subject
but
though
she
never
spoke
of
it
out
of
her
own
family
elinor
could
see
its
influence
on
her
mind
in
the
something
like
confusion
of
countenance
with
which
she
entered
and
an
attempt
at
cordiality
in
her
behaviour
to
herself
she
even
proceeded
so
far
as
to
be
concerned
to
find
that
elinor
and
her
sister
were
so
soon
to
leave
town
as
she
had
hoped
to
see
more
of
them
an
exertion
in
which
her
husband
who
attended
her
into
the
room
and
hung
enamoured
over
her
accents
seemed
to
distinguish
every
thing
that
was
most
affectionate
and
graceful
one
other
short
call
in
harley
street
in
which
elinor
received
her
brother
s
congratulations
on
their
travelling
so
far
towards
barton
without
any
expense
and
on
colonel
brandon
s
being
to
follow
them
to
cleveland
in
a
day
or
two
completed
the
intercourse
of
the
brother
and
sisters
in
town
and
a
faint
invitation
from
fanny
to
come
to
norland
whenever
it
should
happen
to
be
in
their
way
which
of
all
things
was
the
most
unlikely
to
occur
with
a
more
warm
though
less
public
assurance
from
john
to
elinor
of
the
promptitude
with
which
he
should
come
to
see
her
at
delaford
was
all
that
foretold
any
meeting
in
the
country
it
amused
her
to
observe
that
all
her
friends
seemed
determined
to
send
her
to
delaford
a
place
in
which
of
all
others
she
would
now
least
chuse
to
visit
or
wish
to
reside
for
not
only
was
it
considered
as
her
future
home
by
her
brother
and
mrs
jennings
but
even
lucy
when
they
parted
gave
her
a
pressing
invitation
to
visit
her
there
very
early
in
april
and
tolerably
early
in
the
day
the
two
parties
from
hanover
square
and
berkeley
street
set
out
from
their
respective
homes
to
meet
by
appointment
on
the
road
for
the
convenience
of
charlotte
and
her
child
they
were
to
be
more
than
two
days
on
their
journey
and
mr
palmer
travelling
more
expeditiously
with
colonel
brandon
was
to
join
them
at
cleveland
soon
after
their
arrival
marianne
few
as
had
been
her
hours
of
comfort
in
london
and
eager
as
she
had
long
been
to
quit
it
could
not
when
it
came
to
the
point
bid
adieu
to
the
house
in
which
she
had
for
the
last
time
enjoyed
those
hopes
and
that
confidence
in
willoughby
which
were
now
extinguished
for
ever
without
great
pain
nor
could
she
leave
the
place
in
which
willoughby
remained
busy
in
new
engagements
and
new
schemes
in
which
she
could
have
no
share
without
shedding
many
tears
elinor
s
satisfaction
at
the
moment
of
removal
was
more
positive
she
had
no
such
object
for
her
lingering
thoughts
to
fix
on
she
left
no
creature
behind
from
whom
it
would
give
her
a
moment
s
regret
to
be
divided
for
ever
she
was
pleased
to
be
free
herself
from
the
persecution
of
lucy
s
friendship
she
was
grateful
for
bringing
her
sister
away
unseen
by
willoughby
since
his
marriage
and
she
looked
forward
with
hope
to
what
a
few
months
of
tranquility
at
barton
might
do
towards
restoring
marianne
s
peace
of
mind
and
confirming
her
own
their
journey
was
safely
performed
the
second
day
brought
them
into
the
cherished
or
the
prohibited
county
of
somerset
for
as
such
was
it
dwelt
on
by
turns
in
marianne
s
imagination
and
in
the
forenoon
of
the
third
they
drove
up
to
cleveland
cleveland
was
a
spacious
modern
built
house
situated
on
a
sloping
lawn
it
had
no
park
but
the
pleasure
grounds
were
tolerably
extensive
and
like
every
other
place
of
the
same
degree
of
importance
it
had
its
open
shrubbery
and
closer
wood
walk
a
road
of
smooth
gravel
winding
round
a
plantation
led
to
the
front
the
lawn
was
dotted
over
with
timber
the
house
itself
was
under
the
guardianship
of
the
fir
the
mountain
ash
and
the
acacia
and
a
thick
screen
of
them
altogether
interspersed
with
tall
lombardy
poplars
shut
out
the
offices
marianne
entered
the
house
with
a
heart
swelling
with
emotion
from
the
consciousness
of
being
only
eighty
miles
from
barton
and
not
thirty
from
combe
magna
and
before
she
had
been
five
minutes
within
its
walls
while
the
others
were
busily
helping
charlotte
to
show
her
child
to
the
housekeeper
she
quitted
it
again
stealing
away
through
the
winding
shrubberies
now
just
beginning
to
be
in
beauty
to
gain
a
distant
eminence
where
from
its
grecian
temple
her
eye
wandering
over
a
wide
tract
of
country
to
the
south
east
could
fondly
rest
on
the
farthest
ridge
of
hills
in
the
horizon
and
fancy
that
from
their
summits
combe
magna
might
be
seen
in
such
moments
of
precious
invaluable
misery
she
rejoiced
in
tears
of
agony
to
be
at
cleveland
and
as
she
returned
by
a
different
circuit
to
the
house
feeling
all
the
happy
privilege
of
country
liberty
of
wandering
from
place
to
place
in
free
and
luxurious
solitude
she
resolved
to
spend
almost
every
hour
of
every
day
while
she
remained
with
the
palmers
in
the
indulgence
of
such
solitary
rambles
she
returned
just
in
time
to
join
the
others
as
they
quitted
the
house
on
an
excursion
through
its
more
immediate
premises
and
the
rest
of
the
morning
was
easily
whiled
away
in
lounging
round
the
kitchen
garden
examining
the
bloom
upon
its
walls
and
listening
to
the
gardener
s
lamentations
upon
blights
in
dawdling
through
the
green
house
where
the
loss
of
her
favourite
plants
unwarily
exposed
and
nipped
by
the
lingering
frost
raised
the
laughter
of
charlotte
and
in
visiting
her
poultry
yard
where
in
the
disappointed
hopes
of
her
dairy
maid
by
hens
forsaking
their
nests
or
being
stolen
by
a
fox
or
in
the
rapid
decrease
of
a
promising
young
brood
she
found
fresh
sources
of
merriment
the
morning
was
fine
and
dry
and
marianne
in
her
plan
of
employment
abroad
had
not
calculated
for
any
change
of
weather
during
their
stay
at
cleveland
with
great
surprise
therefore
did
she
find
herself
prevented
by
a
settled
rain
from
going
out
again
after
dinner
she
had
depended
on
a
twilight
walk
to
the
grecian
temple
and
perhaps
all
over
the
grounds
and
an
evening
merely
cold
or
damp
would
not
have
deterred
her
from
it
but
a
heavy
and
settled
rain
even
she
could
not
fancy
dry
or
pleasant
weather
for
walking
their
party
was
small
and
the
hours
passed
quietly
away
mrs
palmer
had
her
child
and
mrs
jennings
her
carpet
work
they
talked
of
the
friends
they
had
left
behind
arranged
lady
middleton
s
engagements
and
wondered
whether
mr
palmer
and
colonel
brandon
would
get
farther
than
reading
that
night
elinor
however
little
concerned
in
it
joined
in
their
discourse
and
marianne
who
had
the
knack
of
finding
her
way
in
every
house
to
the
library
however
it
might
be
avoided
by
the
family
in
general
soon
procured
herself
a
book
nothing
was
wanting
on
mrs
palmer
s
side
that
constant
and
friendly
good
humour
could
do
to
make
them
feel
themselves
welcome
the
openness
and
heartiness
of
her
manner
more
than
atoned
for
that
want
of
recollection
and
elegance
which
made
her
often
deficient
in
the
forms
of
politeness
her
kindness
recommended
by
so
pretty
a
face
was
engaging
her
folly
though
evident
was
not
disgusting
because
it
was
not
conceited
and
elinor
could
have
forgiven
every
thing
but
her
laugh
the
two
gentlemen
arrived
the
next
day
to
a
very
late
dinner
affording
a
pleasant
enlargement
of
the
party
and
a
very
welcome
variety
to
their
conversation
which
a
long
morning
of
the
same
continued
rain
had
reduced
very
low
elinor
had
seen
so
little
of
mr
palmer
and
in
that
little
had
seen
so
much
variety
in
his
address
to
her
sister
and
herself
that
she
knew
not
what
to
expect
to
find
him
in
his
own
family
she
found
him
however
perfectly
the
gentleman
in
his
behaviour
to
all
his
visitors
and
only
occasionally
rude
to
his
wife
and
her
mother
she
found
him
very
capable
of
being
a
pleasant
companion
and
only
prevented
from
being
so
always
by
too
great
an
aptitude
to
fancy
himself
as
much
superior
to
people
in
general
as
he
must
feel
himself
to
be
to
mrs
jennings
and
charlotte
for
the
rest
of
his
character
and
habits
they
were
marked
as
far
as
elinor
could
perceive
with
no
traits
at
all
unusual
in
his
sex
and
time
of
life
he
was
nice
in
his
eating
uncertain
in
his
hours
fond
of
his
child
though
affecting
to
slight
it
and
idled
away
the
mornings
at
billiards
which
ought
to
have
been
devoted
to
business
she
liked
him
however
upon
the
whole
much
better
than
she
had
expected
and
in
her
heart
was
not
sorry
that
she
could
like
him
no
more
not
sorry
to
be
driven
by
the
observation
of
his
epicurism
his
selfishness
and
his
conceit
to
rest
with
complacency
on
the
remembrance
of
edward
s
generous
temper
simple
taste
and
diffident
feelings
of
edward
or
at
least
of
some
of
his
concerns
she
now
received
intelligence
from
colonel
brandon
who
had
been
into
dorsetshire
lately
and
who
treating
her
at
once
as
the
disinterested
friend
of
mr
ferrars
and
the
kind
confidante
of
himself
talked
to
her
a
great
deal
of
the
parsonage
at
delaford
described
its
deficiencies
and
told
her
what
he
meant
to
do
himself
towards
removing
them
his
behaviour
to
her
in
this
as
well
as
in
every
other
particular
his
open
pleasure
in
meeting
her
after
an
absence
of
only
ten
days
his
readiness
to
converse
with
her
and
his
deference
for
her
opinion
might
very
well
justify
mrs
jennings
s
persuasion
of
his
attachment
and
would
have
been
enough
perhaps
had
not
elinor
still
as
from
the
first
believed
marianne
his
real
favourite
to
make
her
suspect
it
herself
but
as
it
was
such
a
notion
had
scarcely
ever
entered
her
head
except
by
mrs
jennings
s
suggestion
and
she
could
not
help
believing
herself
the
nicest
observer
of
the
two
she
watched
his
eyes
while
mrs
jennings
thought
only
of
his
behaviour
and
while
his
looks
of
anxious
solicitude
on
marianne
s
feeling
in
her
head
and
throat
the
beginning
of
a
heavy
cold
because
unexpressed
by
words
entirely
escaped
the
latter
lady
s
observation
she
could
discover
in
them
the
quick
feelings
and
needless
alarm
of
a
lover
two
delightful
twilight
walks
on
the
third
and
fourth
evenings
of
her
being
there
not
merely
on
the
dry
gravel
of
the
shrubbery
but
all
over
the
grounds
and
especially
in
the
most
distant
parts
of
them
where
there
was
something
more
of
wildness
than
in
the
rest
where
the
trees
were
the
oldest
and
the
grass
was
the
longest
and
wettest
had
assisted
by
the
still
greater
imprudence
of
sitting
in
her
wet
shoes
and
stockings
given
marianne
a
cold
so
violent
as
though
for
a
day
or
two
trifled
with
or
denied
would
force
itself
by
increasing
ailments
on
the
concern
of
every
body
and
the
notice
of
herself
prescriptions
poured
in
from
all
quarters
and
as
usual
were
all
declined
though
heavy
and
feverish
with
a
pain
in
her
limbs
and
a
cough
and
a
sore
throat
a
good
night
s
rest
was
to
cure
her
entirely
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
elinor
prevailed
on
her
when
she
went
to
bed
to
try
one
or
two
of
the
simplest
of
the
remedies
marianne
got
up
the
next
morning
at
her
usual
time
to
every
inquiry
replied
that
she
was
better
and
tried
to
prove
herself
so
by
engaging
in
her
accustomary
employments
but
a
day
spent
in
sitting
shivering
over
the
fire
with
a
book
in
her
hand
which
she
was
unable
to
read
or
in
lying
weary
and
languid
on
a
sofa
did
not
speak
much
in
favour
of
her
amendment
and
when
at
last
she
went
early
to
bed
more
and
more
indisposed
colonel
brandon
was
only
astonished
at
her
sister
s
composure
who
though
attending
and
nursing
her
the
whole
day
against
marianne
s
inclination
and
forcing
proper
medicines
on
her
at
night
trusted
like
marianne
to
the
certainty
and
efficacy
of
sleep
and
felt
no
real
alarm
a
very
restless
and
feverish
night
however
disappointed
the
expectation
of
both
and
when
marianne
after
persisting
in
rising
confessed
herself
unable
to
sit
up
and
returned
voluntarily
to
her
bed
elinor
was
very
ready
to
adopt
mrs
jennings
s
advice
of
sending
for
the
palmers
apothecary
he
came
examined
his
patient
and
though
encouraging
miss
dashwood
to
expect
that
a
very
few
days
would
restore
her
sister
to
health
yet
by
pronouncing
her
disorder
to
have
a
putrid
tendency
and
allowing
the
word
infection
to
pass
his
lips
gave
instant
alarm
to
mrs
palmer
on
her
baby
s
account
mrs
jennings
who
had
been
inclined
from
the
first
to
think
marianne
s
complaint
more
serious
than
elinor
now
looked
very
grave
on
mr
harris
s
report
and
confirming
charlotte
s
fears
and
caution
urged
the
necessity
of
her
immediate
removal
with
her
infant
and
mr
palmer
though
treating
their
apprehensions
as
idle
found
the
anxiety
and
importunity
of
his
wife
too
great
to
be
withstood
her
departure
therefore
was
fixed
on
and
within
an
hour
after
mr
harris
s
arrival
she
set
off
with
her
little
boy
and
his
nurse
for
the
house
of
a
near
relation
of
mr
palmer
s
who
lived
a
few
miles
on
the
other
side
of
bath
whither
her
husband
promised
at
her
earnest
entreaty
to
join
her
in
a
day
or
two
and
whither
she
was
almost
equally
urgent
with
her
mother
to
accompany
her
mrs
jennings
however
with
a
kindness
of
heart
which
made
elinor
really
love
her
declared
her
resolution
of
not
stirring
from
cleveland
as
long
as
marianne
remained
ill
and
of
endeavouring
by
her
own
attentive
care
to
supply
to
her
the
place
of
the
mother
she
had
taken
her
from
and
elinor
found
her
on
every
occasion
a
most
willing
and
active
helpmate
desirous
to
share
in
all
her
fatigues
and
often
by
her
better
experience
in
nursing
of
material
use
poor
marianne
languid
and
low
from
the
nature
of
her
malady
and
feeling
herself
universally
ill
could
no
longer
hope
that
tomorrow
would
find
her
recovered
and
the
idea
of
what
tomorrow
would
have
produced
but
for
this
unlucky
illness
made
every
ailment
severe
for
on
that
day
they
were
to
have
begun
their
journey
home
and
attended
the
whole
way
by
a
servant
of
mrs
jennings
were
to
have
taken
their
mother
by
surprise
on
the
following
forenoon
the
little
she
said
was
all
in
lamentation
of
this
inevitable
delay
though
elinor
tried
to
raise
her
spirits
and
make
her
believe
as
she
then
really
believed
herself
that
it
would
be
a
very
short
one
the
next
day
produced
little
or
no
alteration
in
the
state
of
the
patient
she
certainly
was
not
better
and
except
that
there
was
no
amendment
did
not
appear
worse
their
party
was
now
farther
reduced
for
mr
palmer
though
very
unwilling
to
go
as
well
from
real
humanity
and
good
nature
as
from
a
dislike
of
appearing
to
be
frightened
away
by
his
wife
was
persuaded
at
last
by
colonel
brandon
to
perform
his
promise
of
following
her
and
while
he
was
preparing
to
go
colonel
brandon
himself
with
a
much
greater
exertion
began
to
talk
of
going
likewise
here
however
the
kindness
of
mrs
jennings
interposed
most
acceptably
for
to
send
the
colonel
away
while
his
love
was
in
so
much
uneasiness
on
her
sister
s
account
would
be
to
deprive
them
both
she
thought
of
every
comfort
and
therefore
telling
him
at
once
that
his
stay
at
cleveland
was
necessary
to
herself
that
she
should
want
him
to
play
at
piquet
of
an
evening
while
miss
dashwood
was
above
with
her
sister
c
she
urged
him
so
strongly
to
remain
that
he
who
was
gratifying
the
first
wish
of
his
own
heart
by
a
compliance
could
not
long
even
affect
to
demur
especially
as
mrs
jennings
s
entreaty
was
warmly
seconded
by
mr
palmer
who
seemed
to
feel
a
relief
to
himself
in
leaving
behind
him
a
person
so
well
able
to
assist
or
advise
miss
dashwood
in
any
emergence
marianne
was
of
course
kept
in
ignorance
of
all
these
arrangements
she
knew
not
that
she
had
been
the
means
of
sending
the
owners
of
cleveland
away
in
about
seven
days
from
the
time
of
their
arrival
it
gave
her
no
surprise
that
she
saw
nothing
of
mrs
palmer
and
as
it
gave
her
likewise
no
concern
she
never
mentioned
her
name
two
days
passed
away
from
the
time
of
mr
palmer
s
departure
and
her
situation
continued
with
little
variation
the
same
mr
harris
who
attended
her
every
day
still
talked
boldly
of
a
speedy
recovery
and
miss
dashwood
was
equally
sanguine
but
the
expectation
of
the
others
was
by
no
means
so
cheerful
mrs
jennings
had
determined
very
early
in
the
seizure
that
marianne
would
never
get
over
it
and
colonel
brandon
who
was
chiefly
of
use
in
listening
to
mrs
jennings
s
forebodings
was
not
in
a
state
of
mind
to
resist
their
influence
he
tried
to
reason
himself
out
of
fears
which
the
different
judgment
of
the
apothecary
seemed
to
render
absurd
but
the
many
hours
of
each
day
in
which
he
was
left
entirely
alone
were
but
too
favourable
for
the
admission
of
every
melancholy
idea
and
he
could
not
expel
from
his
mind
the
persuasion
that
he
should
see
marianne
no
more
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
however
the
gloomy
anticipations
of
both
were
almost
done
away
for
when
mr
harris
arrived
he
declared
his
patient
materially
better
her
pulse
was
much
stronger
and
every
symptom
more
favourable
than
on
the
preceding
visit
elinor
confirmed
in
every
pleasant
hope
was
all
cheerfulness
rejoicing
that
in
her
letters
to
her
mother
she
had
pursued
her
own
judgment
rather
than
her
friend
s
in
making
very
light
of
the
indisposition
which
delayed
them
at
cleveland
and
almost
fixing
on
the
time
when
marianne
would
be
able
to
travel
but
the
day
did
not
close
so
auspiciously
as
it
began
towards
the
evening
marianne
became
ill
again
growing
more
heavy
restless
and
uncomfortable
than
before
her
sister
however
still
sanguine
was
willing
to
attribute
the
change
to
nothing
more
than
the
fatigue
of
having
sat
up
to
have
her
bed
made
and
carefully
administering
the
cordials
prescribed
saw
her
with
satisfaction
sink
at
last
into
a
slumber
from
which
she
expected
the
most
beneficial
effects
her
sleep
though
not
so
quiet
as
elinor
wished
to
see
it
lasted
a
considerable
time
and
anxious
to
observe
the
result
of
it
herself
she
resolved
to
sit
with
her
during
the
whole
of
it
mrs
jennings
knowing
nothing
of
any
change
in
the
patient
went
unusually
early
to
bed
her
maid
who
was
one
of
the
principal
nurses
was
recreating
herself
in
the
housekeeper
s
room
and
elinor
remained
alone
with
marianne
the
repose
of
the
latter
became
more
and
more
disturbed
and
her
sister
who
watched
with
unremitting
attention
her
continual
change
of
posture
and
heard
the
frequent
but
inarticulate
sounds
of
complaint
which
passed
her
lips
was
almost
wishing
to
rouse
her
from
so
painful
a
slumber
when
marianne
suddenly
awakened
by
some
accidental
noise
in
the
house
started
hastily
up
and
with
feverish
wildness
cried
out
is
mama
coming
not
yet
cried
the
other
concealing
her
terror
and
assisting
marianne
to
lie
down
again
but
she
will
be
here
i
hope
before
it
is
long
it
is
a
great
way
you
know
from
hence
to
barton
but
she
must
not
go
round
by
london
cried
marianne
in
the
same
hurried
manner
i
shall
never
see
her
if
she
goes
by
london
elinor
perceived
with
alarm
that
she
was
not
quite
herself
and
while
attempting
to
soothe
her
eagerly
felt
her
pulse
it
was
lower
and
quicker
than
ever
and
marianne
still
talking
wildly
of
mama
her
alarm
increased
so
rapidly
as
to
determine
her
on
sending
instantly
for
mr
harris
and
despatching
a
messenger
to
barton
for
her
mother
to
consult
with
colonel
brandon
on
the
best
means
of
effecting
the
latter
was
a
thought
which
immediately
followed
the
resolution
of
its
performance
and
as
soon
she
had
rung
up
the
maid
to
take
her
place
by
her
sister
she
hastened
down
to
the
drawing
room
where
she
knew
he
was
generally
to
be
found
at
a
much
later
hour
than
the
present
it
was
no
time
for
hesitation
her
fears
and
her
difficulties
were
immediately
before
him
her
fears
he
had
no
courage
no
confidence
to
attempt
the
removal
of
he
listened
to
them
in
silent
despondence
but
her
difficulties
were
instantly
obviated
for
with
a
readiness
that
seemed
to
speak
the
occasion
and
the
service
pre
arranged
in
his
mind
he
offered
himself
as
the
messenger
who
should
fetch
mrs
dashwood
elinor
made
no
resistance
that
was
not
easily
overcome
she
thanked
him
with
brief
though
fervent
gratitude
and
while
he
went
to
hurry
off
his
servant
with
a
message
to
mr
harris
and
an
order
for
post
horses
directly
she
wrote
a
few
lines
to
her
mother
the
comfort
of
such
a
friend
at
that
moment
as
colonel
brandon
or
such
a
companion
for
her
mother
how
gratefully
was
it
felt
a
companion
whose
judgment
would
guide
whose
attendance
must
relieve
and
whose
friendship
might
soothe
her
as
far
as
the
shock
of
such
a
summons
could
be
lessened
to
her
his
presence
his
manners
his
assistance
would
lessen
it
he
meanwhile
whatever
he
might
feel
acted
with
all
the
firmness
of
a
collected
mind
made
every
necessary
arrangement
with
the
utmost
despatch
and
calculated
with
exactness
the
time
in
which
she
might
look
for
his
return
not
a
moment
was
lost
in
delay
of
any
kind
the
horses
arrived
even
before
they
were
expected
and
colonel
brandon
only
pressing
her
hand
with
a
look
of
solemnity
and
a
few
words
spoken
too
low
to
reach
her
ear
hurried
into
the
carriage
it
was
then
about
twelve
o
clock
and
she
returned
to
her
sister
s
apartment
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
the
apothecary
and
to
watch
by
her
the
rest
of
the
night
it
was
a
night
of
almost
equal
suffering
to
both
hour
after
hour
passed
away
in
sleepless
pain
and
delirium
on
marianne
s
side
and
in
the
most
cruel
anxiety
on
elinor
s
before
mr
harris
appeared
her
apprehensions
once
raised
paid
by
their
excess
for
all
her
former
security
and
the
servant
who
sat
up
with
her
for
she
would
not
allow
mrs
jennings
to
be
called
only
tortured
her
more
by
hints
of
what
her
mistress
had
always
thought
marianne
s
ideas
were
still
at
intervals
fixed
incoherently
on
her
mother
and
whenever
she
mentioned
her
name
it
gave
a
pang
to
the
heart
of
poor
elinor
who
reproaching
herself
for
having
trifled
with
so
many
days
of
illness
and
wretched
for
some
immediate
relief
fancied
that
all
relief
might
soon
be
in
vain
that
every
thing
had
been
delayed
too
long
and
pictured
to
herself
her
suffering
mother
arriving
too
late
to
see
this
darling
child
or
to
see
her
rational
she
was
on
the
point
of
sending
again
for
mr
harris
or
if
he
could
not
come
for
some
other
advice
when
the
former
but
not
till
after
five
o
clock
arrived
his
opinion
however
made
some
little
amends
for
his
delay
for
though
acknowledging
a
very
unexpected
and
unpleasant
alteration
in
his
patient
he
would
not
allow
the
danger
to
be
material
and
talked
of
the
relief
which
a
fresh
mode
of
treatment
must
procure
with
a
confidence
which
in
a
lesser
degree
was
communicated
to
elinor
he
promised
to
call
again
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
hours
and
left
both
the
patient
and
her
anxious
attendant
more
composed
than
he
had
found
them
with
strong
concern
and
with
many
reproaches
for
not
being
called
to
their
aid
did
mrs
jennings
hear
in
the
morning
of
what
had
passed
her
former
apprehensions
now
with
greater
reason
restored
left
her
no
doubt
of
the
event
and
though
trying
to
speak
comfort
to
elinor
her
conviction
of
her
sister
s
danger
would
not
allow
her
to
offer
the
comfort
of
hope
her
heart
was
really
grieved
the
rapid
decay
the
early
death
of
a
girl
so
young
so
lovely
as
marianne
must
have
struck
a
less
interested
person
with
concern
on
mrs
jennings
s
compassion
she
had
other
claims
she
had
been
for
three
months
her
companion
was
still
under
her
care
and
she
was
known
to
have
been
greatly
injured
and
long
unhappy
the
distress
of
her
sister
too
particularly
a
favourite
was
before
her
and
as
for
their
mother
when
mrs
jennings
considered
that
marianne
might
probably
be
to
her
what
charlotte
was
to
herself
her
sympathy
in
her
sufferings
was
very
sincere
mr
harris
was
punctual
in
his
second
visit
but
he
came
to
be
disappointed
in
his
hopes
of
what
the
last
would
produce
his
medicines
had
failed
the
fever
was
unabated
and
marianne
only
more
quiet
not
more
herself
remained
in
a
heavy
stupor
elinor
catching
all
and
more
than
all
his
fears
in
a
moment
proposed
to
call
in
further
advice
but
he
judged
it
unnecessary
he
had
still
something
more
to
try
some
more
fresh
application
of
whose
success
he
was
as
confident
as
the
last
and
his
visit
concluded
with
encouraging
assurances
which
reached
the
ear
but
could
not
enter
the
heart
of
miss
dashwood
she
was
calm
except
when
she
thought
of
her
mother
but
she
was
almost
hopeless
and
in
this
state
she
continued
till
noon
scarcely
stirring
from
her
sister
s
bed
her
thoughts
wandering
from
one
image
of
grief
one
suffering
friend
to
another
and
her
spirits
oppressed
to
the
utmost
by
the
conversation
of
mrs
jennings
who
scrupled
not
to
attribute
the
severity
and
danger
of
this
attack
to
the
many
weeks
of
previous
indisposition
which
marianne
s
disappointment
had
brought
on
elinor
felt
all
the
reasonableness
of
the
idea
and
it
gave
fresh
misery
to
her
reflections
about
noon
however
she
began
but
with
a
caution
a
dread
of
disappointment
which
for
some
time
kept
her
silent
even
to
her
friend
to
fancy
to
hope
she
could
perceive
a
slight
amendment
in
her
sister
s
pulse
she
waited
watched
and
examined
it
again
and
again
and
at
last
with
an
agitation
more
difficult
to
bury
under
exterior
calmness
than
all
her
foregoing
distress
ventured
to
communicate
her
hopes
mrs
jennings
though
forced
on
examination
to
acknowledge
a
temporary
revival
tried
to
keep
her
young
friend
from
indulging
a
thought
of
its
continuance
and
elinor
conning
over
every
injunction
of
distrust
told
herself
likewise
not
to
hope
but
it
was
too
late
hope
had
already
entered
and
feeling
all
its
anxious
flutter
she
bent
over
her
sister
to
watch
she
hardly
knew
for
what
half
an
hour
passed
away
and
the
favourable
symptom
yet
blessed
her
others
even
arose
to
confirm
it
her
breath
her
skin
her
lips
all
flattered
elinor
with
signs
of
amendment
and
marianne
fixed
her
eyes
on
her
with
a
rational
though
languid
gaze
anxiety
and
hope
now
oppressed
her
in
equal
degrees
and
left
her
no
moment
of
tranquillity
till
the
arrival
of
mr
harris
at
four
o
clock
when
his
assurances
his
felicitations
on
a
recovery
in
her
sister
even
surpassing
his
expectation
gave
her
confidence
comfort
and
tears
of
joy
marianne
was
in
every
respect
materially
better
and
he
declared
her
entirely
out
of
danger
mrs
jennings
perhaps
satisfied
with
the
partial
justification
of
her
forebodings
which
had
been
found
in
their
late
alarm
allowed
herself
to
trust
in
his
judgment
and
admitted
with
unfeigned
joy
and
soon
with
unequivocal
cheerfulness
the
probability
of
an
entire
recovery
elinor
could
not
be
cheerful
her
joy
was
of
a
different
kind
and
led
to
any
thing
rather
than
to
gaiety
marianne
restored
to
life
health
friends
and
to
her
doting
mother
was
an
idea
to
fill
her
heart
with
sensations
of
exquisite
comfort
and
expand
it
in
fervent
gratitude
but
it
led
to
no
outward
demonstrations
of
joy
no
words
no
smiles
all
within
elinor
s
breast
was
satisfaction
silent
and
strong
she
continued
by
the
side
of
her
sister
with
little
intermission
the
whole
afternoon
calming
every
fear
satisfying
every
inquiry
of
her
enfeebled
spirits
supplying
every
succour
and
watching
almost
every
look
and
every
breath
the
possibility
of
a
relapse
would
of
course
in
some
moments
occur
to
remind
her
of
what
anxiety
was
but
when
she
saw
on
her
frequent
and
minute
examination
that
every
symptom
of
recovery
continued
and
saw
marianne
at
six
o
clock
sink
into
a
quiet
steady
and
to
all
appearance
comfortable
sleep
she
silenced
every
doubt
the
time
was
now
drawing
on
when
colonel
brandon
might
be
expected
back
at
ten
o
clock
she
trusted
or
at
least
not
much
later
her
mother
would
be
relieved
from
the
dreadful
suspense
in
which
she
must
now
be
travelling
towards
them
the
colonel
too
perhaps
scarcely
less
an
object
of
pity
oh
how
slow
was
the
progress
of
time
which
yet
kept
them
in
ignorance
at
seven
o
clock
leaving
marianne
still
sweetly
asleep
she
joined
mrs
jennings
in
the
drawing
room
to
tea
of
breakfast
she
had
been
kept
by
her
fears
and
of
dinner
by
their
sudden
reverse
from
eating
much
and
the
present
refreshment
therefore
with
such
feelings
of
content
as
she
brought
to
it
was
particularly
welcome
mrs
jennings
would
have
persuaded
her
at
its
conclusion
to
take
some
rest
before
her
mother
s
arrival
and
allow
her
to
take
her
place
by
marianne
but
elinor
had
no
sense
of
fatigue
no
capability
of
sleep
at
that
moment
about
her
and
she
was
not
to
be
kept
away
from
her
sister
an
unnecessary
instant
mrs
jennings
therefore
attending
her
up
stairs
into
the
sick
chamber
to
satisfy
herself
that
all
continued
right
left
her
there
again
to
her
charge
and
her
thoughts
and
retired
to
her
own
room
to
write
letters
and
sleep
the
night
was
cold
and
stormy
the
wind
roared
round
the
house
and
the
rain
beat
against
the
windows
but
elinor
all
happiness
within
regarded
it
not
marianne
slept
through
every
blast
and
the
travellers
they
had
a
rich
reward
in
store
for
every
present
inconvenience
the
clock
struck
eight
had
it
been
ten
elinor
would
have
been
convinced
that
at
that
moment
she
heard
a
carriage
driving
up
to
the
house
and
so
strong
was
the
persuasion
that
she
did
in
spite
of
the
almost
impossibility
of
their
being
already
come
that
she
moved
into
the
adjoining
dressing
closet
and
opened
a
window
shutter
to
be
satisfied
of
the
truth
she
instantly
saw
that
her
ears
had
not
deceived
her
the
flaring
lamps
of
a
carriage
were
immediately
in
view
by
their
uncertain
light
she
thought
she
could
discern
it
to
be
drawn
by
four
horses
and
this
while
it
told
the
excess
of
her
poor
mother
s
alarm
gave
some
explanation
to
such
unexpected
rapidity
never
in
her
life
had
elinor
found
it
so
difficult
to
be
calm
as
at
that
moment
the
knowledge
of
what
her
mother
must
be
feeling
as
the
carriage
stopt
at
the
door
of
her
doubt
her
dread
perhaps
her
despair
and
of
what
she
had
to
tell
with
such
knowledge
it
was
impossible
to
be
calm
all
that
remained
to
be
done
was
to
be
speedy
and
therefore
staying
only
till
she
could
leave
mrs
jennings
s
maid
with
her
sister
she
hurried
down
stairs
the
bustle
in
the
vestibule
as
she
passed
along
an
inner
lobby
assured
her
that
they
were
already
in
the
house
she
rushed
to
the
drawing
room
she
entered
it
and
saw
only
willoughby
elinor
starting
back
with
a
look
of
horror
at
the
sight
of
him
obeyed
the
first
impulse
of
her
heart
in
turning
instantly
to
quit
the
room
and
her
hand
was
already
on
the
lock
when
its
action
was
suspended
by
his
hastily
advancing
and
saying
in
a
voice
rather
of
command
than
supplication
miss
dashwood
for
half
an
hour
for
ten
minutes
i
entreat
you
to
stay
no
sir
she
replied
with
firmness
i
shall
not
stay
your
business
cannot
be
with
me
the
servants
i
suppose
forgot
to
tell
you
that
mr
palmer
was
not
in
the
house
had
they
told
me
he
cried
with
vehemence
that
mr
palmer
and
all
his
relations
were
at
the
devil
it
would
not
have
turned
me
from
the
door
my
business
is
with
you
and
only
you
with
me
in
the
utmost
amazement
well
sir
be
quick
and
if
you
can
less
violent
sit
down
and
i
will
be
both
she
hesitated
she
knew
not
what
to
do
the
possibility
of
colonel
brandon
s
arriving
and
finding
her
there
came
across
her
but
she
had
promised
to
hear
him
and
her
curiosity
no
less
than
her
honor
was
engaged
after
a
moment
s
recollection
therefore
concluding
that
prudence
required
dispatch
and
that
her
acquiescence
would
best
promote
it
she
walked
silently
towards
the
table
and
sat
down
he
took
the
opposite
chair
and
for
half
a
minute
not
a
word
was
said
by
either
pray
be
quick
sir
said
elinor
impatiently
i
have
no
time
to
spare
he
was
sitting
in
an
attitude
of
deep
meditation
and
seemed
not
to
hear
her
your
sister
said
he
with
abruptness
a
moment
afterwards
is
out
of
danger
i
heard
it
from
the
servant
god
be
praised
but
is
it
true
is
it
really
true
elinor
would
not
speak
he
repeated
the
inquiry
with
yet
greater
eagerness
for
god
s
sake
tell
me
is
she
out
of
danger
or
is
she
not
we
hope
she
is
he
rose
up
and
walked
across
the
room
had
i
known
as
much
half
an
hour
ago
but
since
i
am
here
speaking
with
a
forced
vivacity
as
he
returned
to
his
seat
what
does
it
signify
for
once
miss
dashwood
it
will
be
the
last
time
perhaps
let
us
be
cheerful
together
i
am
in
a
fine
mood
for
gaiety
tell
me
honestly
a
deeper
glow
overspreading
his
cheeks
do
you
think
me
most
a
knave
or
a
fool
elinor
looked
at
him
with
greater
astonishment
than
ever
she
began
to
think
that
he
must
be
in
liquor
the
strangeness
of
such
a
visit
and
of
such
manners
seemed
no
otherwise
intelligible
and
with
this
impression
she
immediately
rose
saying
mr
willoughby
i
advise
you
at
present
to
return
to
combe
i
am
not
at
leisure
to
remain
with
you
longer
whatever
your
business
may
be
with
me
it
will
be
better
recollected
and
explained
to
morrow
i
understand
you
he
replied
with
an
expressive
smile
and
a
voice
perfectly
calm
yes
i
am
very
drunk
a
pint
of
porter
with
my
cold
beef
at
marlborough
was
enough
to
over
set
me
at
marlborough
cried
elinor
more
and
more
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
he
would
be
at
yes
i
left
london
this
morning
at
eight
o
clock
and
the
only
ten
minutes
i
have
spent
out
of
my
chaise
since
that
time
procured
me
a
nuncheon
at
marlborough
the
steadiness
of
his
manner
and
the
intelligence
of
his
eye
as
he
spoke
convincing
elinor
that
whatever
other
unpardonable
folly
might
bring
him
to
cleveland
he
was
not
brought
there
by
intoxication
she
said
after
a
moment
s
recollection
mr
willoughby
you
ought
to
feel
and
i
certainly
do
that
after
what
has
passed
your
coming
here
in
this
manner
and
forcing
yourself
upon
my
notice
requires
a
very
particular
excuse
what
is
it
that
you
mean
by
it
i
mean
said
he
with
serious
energy
if
i
can
to
make
you
hate
me
one
degree
less
than
you
do
now
i
mean
to
offer
some
kind
of
explanation
some
kind
of
apology
for
the
past
to
open
my
whole
heart
to
you
and
by
convincing
you
that
though
i
have
been
always
a
blockhead
i
have
not
been
always
a
rascal
to
obtain
something
like
forgiveness
from
ma
from
your
sister
is
this
the
real
reason
of
your
coming
upon
my
soul
it
is
was
his
answer
with
a
warmth
which
brought
all
the
former
willoughby
to
her
remembrance
and
in
spite
of
herself
made
her
think
him
sincere
if
that
is
all
you
may
be
satisfied
already
for
marianne
does
she
has
long
forgiven
you
has
she
he
cried
in
the
same
eager
tone
then
she
has
forgiven
me
before
she
ought
to
have
done
it
but
she
shall
forgive
me
again
and
on
more
reasonable
grounds
now
will
you
listen
to
me
elinor
bowed
her
assent
i
do
not
know
said
he
after
a
pause
of
expectation
on
her
side
and
thoughtfulness
on
his
own
how
you
may
have
accounted
for
my
behaviour
to
your
sister
or
what
diabolical
motive
you
may
have
imputed
to
me
perhaps
you
will
hardly
think
the
better
of
me
it
is
worth
the
trial
however
and
you
shall
hear
every
thing
when
i
first
became
intimate
in
your
family
i
had
no
other
intention
no
other
view
in
the
acquaintance
than
to
pass
my
time
pleasantly
while
i
was
obliged
to
remain
in
devonshire
more
pleasantly
than
i
had
ever
done
before
your
sister
s
lovely
person
and
interesting
manners
could
not
but
please
me
and
her
behaviour
to
me
almost
from
the
first
was
of
a
kind
it
is
astonishing
when
i
reflect
on
what
it
was
and
what
she
was
that
my
heart
should
have
been
so
insensible
but
at
first
i
must
confess
my
vanity
only
was
elevated
by
it
careless
of
her
happiness
thinking
only
of
my
own
amusement
giving
way
to
feelings
which
i
had
always
been
too
much
in
the
habit
of
indulging
i
endeavoured
by
every
means
in
my
power
to
make
myself
pleasing
to
her
without
any
design
of
returning
her
affection
miss
dashwood
at
this
point
turning
her
eyes
on
him
with
the
most
angry
contempt
stopped
him
by
saying
it
is
hardly
worth
while
mr
willoughby
for
you
to
relate
or
for
me
to
listen
any
longer
such
a
beginning
as
this
cannot
be
followed
by
any
thing
do
not
let
me
be
pained
by
hearing
any
thing
more
on
the
subject
i
insist
on
you
hearing
the
whole
of
it
he
replied
my
fortune
was
never
large
and
i
had
always
been
expensive
always
in
the
habit
of
associating
with
people
of
better
income
than
myself
every
year
since
my
coming
of
age
or
even
before
i
believe
had
added
to
my
debts
and
though
the
death
of
my
old
cousin
mrs
smith
was
to
set
me
free
yet
that
event
being
uncertain
and
possibly
far
distant
it
had
been
for
some
time
my
intention
to
re
establish
my
circumstances
by
marrying
a
woman
of
fortune
to
attach
myself
to
your
sister
therefore
was
not
a
thing
to
be
thought
of
and
with
a
meanness
selfishness
cruelty
which
no
indignant
no
contemptuous
look
even
of
yours
miss
dashwood
can
ever
reprobate
too
much
i
was
acting
in
this
manner
trying
to
engage
her
regard
without
a
thought
of
returning
it
but
one
thing
may
be
said
for
me
even
in
that
horrid
state
of
selfish
vanity
i
did
not
know
the
extent
of
the
injury
i
meditated
because
i
did
not
then
know
what
it
was
to
love
but
have
i
ever
known
it
well
may
it
be
doubted
for
had
i
really
loved
could
i
have
sacrificed
my
feelings
to
vanity
to
avarice
or
what
is
more
could
i
have
sacrificed
hers
but
i
have
done
it
to
avoid
a
comparative
poverty
which
her
affection
and
her
society
would
have
deprived
of
all
its
horrors
i
have
by
raising
myself
to
affluence
lost
every
thing
that
could
make
it
a
blessing
you
did
then
said
elinor
a
little
softened
believe
yourself
at
one
time
attached
to
her
to
have
resisted
such
attractions
to
have
withstood
such
tenderness
is
there
a
man
on
earth
who
could
have
done
it
yes
i
found
myself
by
insensible
degrees
sincerely
fond
of
her
and
the
happiest
hours
of
my
life
were
what
i
spent
with
her
when
i
felt
my
intentions
were
strictly
honourable
and
my
feelings
blameless
even
then
however
when
fully
determined
on
paying
my
addresses
to
her
i
allowed
myself
most
improperly
to
put
off
from
day
to
day
the
moment
of
doing
it
from
an
unwillingness
to
enter
into
an
engagement
while
my
circumstances
were
so
greatly
embarrassed
i
will
not
reason
here
nor
will
i
stop
for
you
to
expatiate
on
the
absurdity
and
the
worse
than
absurdity
of
scrupling
to
engage
my
faith
where
my
honour
was
already
bound
the
event
has
proved
that
i
was
a
cunning
fool
providing
with
great
circumspection
for
a
possible
opportunity
of
making
myself
contemptible
and
wretched
for
ever
at
last
however
my
resolution
was
taken
and
i
had
determined
as
soon
as
i
could
engage
her
alone
to
justify
the
attentions
i
had
so
invariably
paid
her
and
openly
assure
her
of
an
affection
which
i
had
already
taken
such
pains
to
display
but
in
the
interim
in
the
interim
of
the
very
few
hours
that
were
to
pass
before
i
could
have
an
opportunity
of
speaking
with
her
in
private
a
circumstance
occurred
an
unlucky
circumstance
to
ruin
all
my
resolution
and
with
it
all
my
comfort
a
discovery
took
place
here
he
hesitated
and
looked
down
mrs
smith
had
somehow
or
other
been
informed
i
imagine
by
some
distant
relation
whose
interest
it
was
to
deprive
me
of
her
favour
of
an
affair
a
connection
but
i
need
not
explain
myself
farther
he
added
looking
at
her
with
an
heightened
colour
and
an
enquiring
eye
your
particular
intimacy
you
have
probably
heard
the
whole
story
long
ago
i
have
returned
elinor
colouring
likewise
and
hardening
her
heart
anew
against
any
compassion
for
him
i
have
heard
it
all
and
how
you
will
explain
away
any
part
of
your
guilt
in
that
dreadful
business
i
confess
is
beyond
my
comprehension
remember
cried
willoughby
from
whom
you
received
the
account
could
it
be
an
impartial
one
i
acknowledge
that
her
situation
and
her
character
ought
to
have
been
respected
by
me
i
do
not
mean
to
justify
myself
but
at
the
same
time
cannot
leave
you
to
suppose
that
i
have
nothing
to
urge
that
because
she
was
injured
she
was
irreproachable
and
because
i
was
a
libertine
she
must
be
a
saint
if
the
violence
of
her
passions
the
weakness
of
her
understanding
i
do
not
mean
however
to
defend
myself
her
affection
for
me
deserved
better
treatment
and
i
often
with
great
self
reproach
recall
the
tenderness
which
for
a
very
short
time
had
the
power
of
creating
any
return
i
wish
i
heartily
wish
it
had
never
been
but
i
have
injured
more
than
herself
and
i
have
injured
one
whose
affection
for
me
may
i
say
it
was
scarcely
less
warm
than
hers
and
whose
mind
oh
how
infinitely
superior
your
indifference
however
towards
that
unfortunate
girl
i
must
say
it
unpleasant
to
me
as
the
discussion
of
such
a
subject
may
well
be
your
indifference
is
no
apology
for
your
cruel
neglect
of
her
do
not
think
yourself
excused
by
any
weakness
any
natural
defect
of
understanding
on
her
side
in
the
wanton
cruelty
so
evident
on
yours
you
must
have
known
that
while
you
were
enjoying
yourself
in
devonshire
pursuing
fresh
schemes
always
gay
always
happy
she
was
reduced
to
the
extremest
indigence
but
upon
my
soul
i
did
not
know
it
he
warmly
replied
i
did
not
recollect
that
i
had
omitted
to
give
her
my
direction
and
common
sense
might
have
told
her
how
to
find
it
out
well
sir
and
what
said
mrs
smith
she
taxed
me
with
the
offence
at
once
and
my
confusion
may
be
guessed
the
purity
of
her
life
the
formality
of
her
notions
her
ignorance
of
the
world
every
thing
was
against
me
the
matter
itself
i
could
not
deny
and
vain
was
every
endeavour
to
soften
it
she
was
previously
disposed
i
believe
to
doubt
the
morality
of
my
conduct
in
general
and
was
moreover
discontented
with
the
very
little
attention
the
very
little
portion
of
my
time
that
i
had
bestowed
on
her
in
my
present
visit
in
short
it
ended
in
a
total
breach
by
one
measure
i
might
have
saved
myself
in
the
height
of
her
morality
good
woman
she
offered
to
forgive
the
past
if
i
would
marry
eliza
that
could
not
be
and
i
was
formally
dismissed
from
her
favour
and
her
house
the
night
following
this
affair
i
was
to
go
the
next
morning
was
spent
by
me
in
deliberating
on
what
my
future
conduct
should
be
the
struggle
was
great
but
it
ended
too
soon
my
affection
for
marianne
my
thorough
conviction
of
her
attachment
to
me
it
was
all
insufficient
to
outweigh
that
dread
of
poverty
or
get
the
better
of
those
false
ideas
of
the
necessity
of
riches
which
i
was
naturally
inclined
to
feel
and
expensive
society
had
increased
i
had
reason
to
believe
myself
secure
of
my
present
wife
if
i
chose
to
address
her
and
i
persuaded
myself
to
think
that
nothing
else
in
common
prudence
remained
for
me
to
do
a
heavy
scene
however
awaited
me
before
i
could
leave
devonshire
i
was
engaged
to
dine
with
you
on
that
very
day
some
apology
was
therefore
necessary
for
my
breaking
this
engagement
but
whether
i
should
write
this
apology
or
deliver
it
in
person
was
a
point
of
long
debate
to
see
marianne
i
felt
would
be
dreadful
and
i
even
doubted
whether
i
could
see
her
again
and
keep
to
my
resolution
in
that
point
however
i
undervalued
my
own
magnanimity
as
the
event
declared
for
i
went
i
saw
her
and
saw
her
miserable
and
left
her
miserable
and
left
her
hoping
never
to
see
her
again
why
did
you
call
mr
willoughby
said
elinor
reproachfully
a
note
would
have
answered
every
purpose
why
was
it
necessary
to
call
it
was
necessary
to
my
own
pride
i
could
not
bear
to
leave
the
country
in
a
manner
that
might
lead
you
or
the
rest
of
the
neighbourhood
to
suspect
any
part
of
what
had
really
passed
between
mrs
smith
and
myself
and
i
resolved
therefore
on
calling
at
the
cottage
in
my
way
to
honiton
the
sight
of
your
dear
sister
however
was
really
dreadful
and
to
heighten
the
matter
i
found
her
alone
you
were
all
gone
i
do
not
know
where
i
had
left
her
only
the
evening
before
so
fully
so
firmly
resolved
within
my
self
on
doing
right
a
few
hours
were
to
have
engaged
her
to
me
for
ever
and
i
remember
how
happy
how
gay
were
my
spirits
as
i
walked
from
the
cottage
to
allenham
satisfied
with
myself
delighted
with
every
body
but
in
this
our
last
interview
of
friendship
i
approached
her
with
a
sense
of
guilt
that
almost
took
from
me
the
power
of
dissembling
her
sorrow
her
disappointment
her
deep
regret
when
i
told
her
that
i
was
obliged
to
leave
devonshire
so
immediately
i
never
shall
forget
it
united
too
with
such
reliance
such
confidence
in
me
oh
god
what
a
hard
hearted
rascal
i
was
they
were
both
silent
for
a
few
moments
elinor
first
spoke
did
you
tell
her
that
you
should
soon
return
i
do
not
know
what
i
told
her
he
replied
impatiently
less
than
was
due
to
the
past
beyond
a
doubt
and
in
all
likelihood
much
more
than
was
justified
by
the
future
i
cannot
think
of
it
it
won
t
do
then
came
your
dear
mother
to
torture
me
farther
with
all
her
kindness
and
confidence
thank
heaven
it
did
torture
me
i
was
miserable
miss
dashwood
you
cannot
have
an
idea
of
the
comfort
it
gives
me
to
look
back
on
my
own
misery
i
owe
such
a
grudge
to
myself
for
the
stupid
rascally
folly
of
my
own
heart
that
all
my
past
sufferings
under
it
are
only
triumph
and
exultation
to
me
now
well
i
went
left
all
that
i
loved
and
went
to
those
to
whom
at
best
i
was
only
indifferent
my
journey
to
town
travelling
with
my
own
horses
and
therefore
so
tediously
no
creature
to
speak
to
my
own
reflections
so
cheerful
when
i
looked
forward
every
thing
so
inviting
when
i
looked
back
at
barton
the
picture
so
soothing
oh
it
was
a
blessed
journey
he
stopped
well
sir
said
elinor
who
though
pitying
him
grew
impatient
for
his
departure
and
this
is
all
ah
no
have
you
forgot
what
passed
in
town
that
infamous
letter
did
she
shew
it
you
yes
i
saw
every
note
that
passed
when
the
first
of
hers
reached
me
as
it
immediately
did
for
i
was
in
town
the
whole
time
what
i
felt
is
in
the
common
phrase
not
to
be
expressed
in
a
more
simple
one
perhaps
too
simple
to
raise
any
emotion
my
feelings
were
very
very
painful
every
line
every
word
was
in
the
hackneyed
metaphor
which
their
dear
writer
were
she
here
would
forbid
a
dagger
to
my
heart
to
know
that
marianne
was
in
town
was
in
the
same
language
a
thunderbolt
thunderbolts
and
daggers
what
a
reproof
would
she
have
given
me
her
taste
her
opinions
i
believe
they
are
better
known
to
me
than
my
own
and
i
am
sure
they
are
dearer
elinor
s
heart
which
had
undergone
many
changes
in
the
course
of
this
extraordinary
conversation
was
now
softened
again
yet
she
felt
it
her
duty
to
check
such
ideas
in
her
companion
as
the
last
this
is
not
right
mr
willoughby
remember
that
you
are
married
relate
only
what
in
your
conscience
you
think
necessary
for
me
to
hear
marianne
s
note
by
assuring
me
that
i
was
still
as
dear
to
her
as
in
former
days
that
in
spite
of
the
many
many
weeks
we
had
been
separated
she
was
as
constant
in
her
own
feelings
and
as
full
of
faith
in
the
constancy
of
mine
as
ever
awakened
all
my
remorse
i
say
awakened
because
time
and
london
business
and
dissipation
had
in
some
measure
quieted
it
and
i
had
been
growing
a
fine
hardened
villain
fancying
myself
indifferent
to
her
and
chusing
to
fancy
that
she
too
must
have
become
indifferent
to
me
talking
to
myself
of
our
past
attachment
as
a
mere
idle
trifling
business
shrugging
up
my
shoulders
in
proof
of
its
being
so
and
silencing
every
reproach
overcoming
every
scruple
by
secretly
saying
now
and
then
i
shall
be
heartily
glad
to
hear
she
is
well
married
but
this
note
made
me
know
myself
better
i
felt
that
she
was
infinitely
dearer
to
me
than
any
other
woman
in
the
world
and
that
i
was
using
her
infamously
but
every
thing
was
then
just
settled
between
miss
grey
and
me
to
retreat
was
impossible
all
that
i
had
to
do
was
to
avoid
you
both
i
sent
no
answer
to
marianne
intending
by
that
to
preserve
myself
from
her
farther
notice
and
for
some
time
i
was
even
determined
not
to
call
in
berkeley
street
but
at
last
judging
it
wiser
to
affect
the
air
of
a
cool
common
acquaintance
than
anything
else
i
watched
you
all
safely
out
of
the
house
one
morning
and
left
my
name
watched
us
out
of
the
house
even
so
you
would
be
surprised
to
hear
how
often
i
watched
you
how
often
i
was
on
the
point
of
falling
in
with
you
i
have
entered
many
a
shop
to
avoid
your
sight
as
the
carriage
drove
by
lodging
as
i
did
in
bond
street
there
was
hardly
a
day
in
which
i
did
not
catch
a
glimpse
of
one
or
other
of
you
and
nothing
but
the
most
constant
watchfulness
on
my
side
a
most
invariably
prevailing
desire
to
keep
out
of
your
sight
could
have
separated
us
so
long
i
avoided
the
middletons
as
much
as
possible
as
well
as
everybody
else
who
was
likely
to
prove
an
acquaintance
in
common
not
aware
of
their
being
in
town
however
i
blundered
on
sir
john
i
believe
the
first
day
of
his
coming
and
the
day
after
i
had
called
at
mrs
jennings
s
he
asked
me
to
a
party
a
dance
at
his
house
in
the
evening
had
he
not
told
me
as
an
inducement
that
you
and
your
sister
were
to
be
there
i
should
have
felt
it
too
certain
a
thing
to
trust
myself
near
him
the
next
morning
brought
another
short
note
from
marianne
still
affectionate
open
artless
confiding
everything
that
could
make
my
conduct
most
hateful
i
could
not
answer
it
i
tried
but
could
not
frame
a
sentence
but
i
thought
of
her
i
believe
every
moment
of
the
day
if
you
can
pity
me
miss
dashwood
pity
my
situation
as
it
was
then
with
my
head
and
heart
full
of
your
sister
i
was
forced
to
play
the
happy
lover
to
another
woman
those
three
or
four
weeks
were
worse
than
all
well
at
last
as
i
need
not
tell
you
you
were
forced
on
me
and
what
a
sweet
figure
i
cut
what
an
evening
of
agony
it
was
marianne
beautiful
as
an
angel
on
one
side
calling
me
willoughby
in
such
a
tone
oh
god
holding
out
her
hand
to
me
asking
me
for
an
explanation
with
those
bewitching
eyes
fixed
in
such
speaking
solicitude
on
my
face
and
sophia
jealous
as
the
devil
on
the
other
hand
looking
all
that
was
well
it
does
not
signify
it
is
over
now
such
an
evening
i
ran
away
from
you
all
as
soon
as
i
could
but
not
before
i
had
seen
marianne
s
sweet
face
as
white
as
death
that
was
the
last
last
look
i
ever
had
of
her
the
last
manner
in
which
she
appeared
to
me
it
was
a
horrid
sight
yet
when
i
thought
of
her
to
day
as
really
dying
it
was
a
kind
of
comfort
to
me
to
imagine
that
i
knew
exactly
how
she
would
appear
to
those
who
saw
her
last
in
this
world
she
was
before
me
constantly
before
me
as
i
travelled
in
the
same
look
and
hue
a
short
pause
of
mutual
thoughtfulness
succeeded
willoughby
first
rousing
himself
broke
it
thus
well
let
me
make
haste
and
be
gone
your
sister
is
certainly
better
certainly
out
of
danger
we
are
assured
of
it
your
poor
mother
too
doting
on
marianne
but
the
letter
mr
willoughby
your
own
letter
have
you
any
thing
to
say
about
that
yes
yes
that
in
particular
your
sister
wrote
to
me
again
you
know
the
very
next
morning
you
saw
what
she
said
i
was
breakfasting
at
the
ellisons
and
her
letter
with
some
others
was
brought
to
me
there
from
my
lodgings
it
happened
to
catch
sophia
s
eye
before
it
caught
mine
and
its
size
the
elegance
of
the
paper
the
hand
writing
altogether
immediately
gave
her
a
suspicion
some
vague
report
had
reached
her
before
of
my
attachment
to
some
young
lady
in
devonshire
and
what
had
passed
within
her
observation
the
preceding
evening
had
marked
who
the
young
lady
was
and
made
her
more
jealous
than
ever
affecting
that
air
of
playfulness
therefore
which
is
delightful
in
a
woman
one
loves
she
opened
the
letter
directly
and
read
its
contents
she
was
well
paid
for
her
impudence
she
read
what
made
her
wretched
her
wretchedness
i
could
have
borne
but
her
passion
her
malice
at
all
events
it
must
be
appeased
and
in
short
what
do
you
think
of
my
wife
s
style
of
letter
writing
delicate
tender
truly
feminine
was
it
not
your
wife
the
letter
was
in
your
own
hand
writing
yes
but
i
had
only
the
credit
of
servilely
copying
such
sentences
as
i
was
ashamed
to
put
my
name
to
the
original
was
all
her
own
her
own
happy
thoughts
and
gentle
diction
but
what
could
i
do
we
were
engaged
every
thing
in
preparation
the
day
almost
fixed
but
i
am
talking
like
a
fool
preparation
day
in
honest
words
her
money
was
necessary
to
me
and
in
a
situation
like
mine
any
thing
was
to
be
done
to
prevent
a
rupture
and
after
all
what
did
it
signify
to
my
character
in
the
opinion
of
marianne
and
her
friends
in
what
language
my
answer
was
couched
it
must
have
been
only
to
one
end
my
business
was
to
declare
myself
a
scoundrel
and
whether
i
did
it
with
a
bow
or
a
bluster
was
of
little
importance
i
am
ruined
for
ever
in
their
opinion
said
i
to
myself
i
am
shut
out
for
ever
from
their
society
they
already
think
me
an
unprincipled
fellow
this
letter
will
only
make
them
think
me
a
blackguard
one
such
were
my
reasonings
as
in
a
sort
of
desperate
carelessness
i
copied
my
wife
s
words
and
parted
with
the
last
relics
of
marianne
her
three
notes
unluckily
they
were
all
in
my
pocketbook
or
i
should
have
denied
their
existence
and
hoarded
them
for
ever
i
was
forced
to
put
them
up
and
could
not
even
kiss
them
and
the
lock
of
hair
that
too
i
had
always
carried
about
me
in
the
same
pocket
book
which
was
now
searched
by
madam
with
the
most
ingratiating
virulence
the
dear
lock
all
every
memento
was
torn
from
me
you
are
very
wrong
mr
willoughby
very
blamable
said
elinor
while
her
voice
in
spite
of
herself
betrayed
her
compassionate
emotion
you
ought
not
to
speak
in
this
way
either
of
mrs
willoughby
or
my
sister
you
had
made
your
own
choice
it
was
not
forced
on
you
your
wife
has
a
claim
to
your
politeness
to
your
respect
at
least
she
must
be
attached
to
you
or
she
would
not
have
married
you
to
treat
her
with
unkindness
to
speak
of
her
slightingly
is
no
atonement
to
marianne
nor
can
i
suppose
it
a
relief
to
your
own
conscience
do
not
talk
to
me
of
my
wife
said
he
with
a
heavy
sigh
she
does
not
deserve
your
compassion
she
knew
i
had
no
regard
for
her
when
we
married
well
married
we
were
and
came
down
to
combe
magna
to
be
happy
and
afterwards
returned
to
town
to
be
gay
and
now
do
you
pity
me
miss
dashwood
or
have
i
said
all
this
to
no
purpose
am
i
be
it
only
one
degree
am
i
less
guilty
in
your
opinion
than
i
was
before
my
intentions
were
not
always
wrong
have
i
explained
away
any
part
of
my
guilt
yes
you
have
certainly
removed
something
a
little
you
have
proved
yourself
on
the
whole
less
faulty
than
i
had
believed
you
you
have
proved
your
heart
less
wicked
much
less
wicked
but
i
hardly
know
the
misery
that
you
have
inflicted
i
hardly
know
what
could
have
made
it
worse
will
you
repeat
to
your
sister
when
she
is
recovered
what
i
have
been
telling
you
let
me
be
a
little
lightened
too
in
her
opinion
as
well
as
in
yours
you
tell
me
that
she
has
forgiven
me
already
let
me
be
able
to
fancy
that
a
better
knowledge
of
my
heart
and
of
my
present
feelings
will
draw
from
her
a
more
spontaneous
more
natural
more
gentle
less
dignified
forgiveness
tell
her
of
my
misery
and
my
penitence
tell
her
that
my
heart
was
never
inconstant
to
her
and
if
you
will
that
at
this
moment
she
is
dearer
to
me
than
ever
i
will
tell
her
all
that
is
necessary
to
what
may
comparatively
be
called
your
justification
but
you
have
not
explained
to
me
the
particular
reason
of
your
coming
now
nor
how
you
heard
of
her
illness
last
night
in
drury
lane
lobby
i
ran
against
sir
john
middleton
and
when
he
saw
who
i
was
for
the
first
time
these
two
months
he
spoke
to
me
that
he
had
cut
me
ever
since
my
marriage
i
had
seen
without
surprise
or
resentment
now
however
his
good
natured
honest
stupid
soul
full
of
indignation
against
me
and
concern
for
your
sister
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
telling
me
what
he
knew
ought
to
though
probably
he
did
not
think
it
would
vex
me
horridly
as
bluntly
as
he
could
speak
it
therefore
he
told
me
that
marianne
dashwood
was
dying
of
a
putrid
fever
at
cleveland
a
letter
that
morning
received
from
mrs
jennings
declared
her
danger
most
imminent
the
palmers
are
all
gone
off
in
a
fright
c
i
was
too
much
shocked
to
be
able
to
pass
myself
off
as
insensible
even
to
the
undiscerning
sir
john
his
heart
was
softened
in
seeing
mine
suffer
and
so
much
of
his
ill
will
was
done
away
that
when
we
parted
he
almost
shook
me
by
the
hand
while
he
reminded
me
of
an
old
promise
about
a
pointer
puppy
what
i
felt
on
hearing
that
your
sister
was
dying
and
dying
too
believing
me
the
greatest
villain
upon
earth
scorning
hating
me
in
her
latest
moments
for
how
could
i
tell
what
horrid
projects
might
not
have
been
imputed
one
person
i
was
sure
would
represent
me
as
capable
of
any
thing
what
i
felt
was
dreadful
my
resolution
was
soon
made
and
at
eight
o
clock
this
morning
i
was
in
my
carriage
now
you
know
all
elinor
made
no
answer
her
thoughts
were
silently
fixed
on
the
irreparable
injury
which
too
early
an
independence
and
its
consequent
habits
of
idleness
dissipation
and
luxury
had
made
in
the
mind
the
character
the
happiness
of
a
man
who
to
every
advantage
of
person
and
talents
united
a
disposition
naturally
open
and
honest
and
a
feeling
affectionate
temper
the
world
had
made
him
extravagant
and
vain
extravagance
and
vanity
had
made
him
cold
hearted
and
selfish
vanity
while
seeking
its
own
guilty
triumph
at
the
expense
of
another
had
involved
him
in
a
real
attachment
which
extravagance
or
at
least
its
offspring
necessity
had
required
to
be
sacrificed
each
faulty
propensity
in
leading
him
to
evil
had
led
him
likewise
to
punishment
the
attachment
from
which
against
honour
against
feeling
against
every
better
interest
he
had
outwardly
torn
himself
now
when
no
longer
allowable
governed
every
thought
and
the
connection
for
the
sake
of
which
he
had
with
little
scruple
left
her
sister
to
misery
was
likely
to
prove
a
source
of
unhappiness
to
himself
of
a
far
more
incurable
nature
from
a
reverie
of
this
kind
she
was
recalled
at
the
end
of
some
minutes
by
willoughby
who
rousing
himself
from
a
reverie
at
least
equally
painful
started
up
in
preparation
for
going
and
said
there
is
no
use
in
staying
here
i
must
be
off
are
you
going
back
to
town
no
to
combe
magna
i
have
business
there
from
thence
to
town
in
a
day
or
two
good
bye
he
held
out
his
hand
she
could
not
refuse
to
give
him
hers
he
pressed
it
with
affection
and
you
do
think
something
better
of
me
than
you
did
said
he
letting
it
fall
and
leaning
against
the
mantel
piece
as
if
forgetting
he
was
to
go
elinor
assured
him
that
she
did
that
she
forgave
pitied
wished
him
well
was
even
interested
in
his
happiness
and
added
some
gentle
counsel
as
to
the
behaviour
most
likely
to
promote
it
his
answer
was
not
very
encouraging
as
to
that
said
he
i
must
rub
through
the
world
as
well
as
i
can
domestic
happiness
is
out
of
the
question
if
however
i
am
allowed
to
think
that
you
and
yours
feel
an
interest
in
my
fate
and
actions
it
may
be
the
means
it
may
put
me
on
my
guard
at
least
it
may
be
something
to
live
for
marianne
to
be
sure
is
lost
to
me
for
ever
were
i
even
by
any
blessed
chance
at
liberty
again
elinor
stopped
him
with
a
reproof
well
he
replied
once
more
good
bye
i
shall
now
go
away
and
live
in
dread
of
one
event
what
do
you
mean
your
sister
s
marriage
you
are
very
wrong
she
can
never
be
more
lost
to
you
than
she
is
now
but
she
will
be
gained
by
some
one
else
and
if
that
some
one
should
be
the
very
he
whom
of
all
others
i
could
least
bear
but
i
will
not
stay
to
rob
myself
of
all
your
compassionate
goodwill
by
shewing
that
where
i
have
most
injured
i
can
least
forgive
good
bye
god
bless
you
and
with
these
words
he
almost
ran
out
of
the
room
elinor
for
some
time
after
he
left
her
for
some
time
even
after
the
sound
of
his
carriage
had
died
away
remained
too
much
oppressed
by
a
crowd
of
ideas
widely
differing
in
themselves
but
of
which
sadness
was
the
general
result
to
think
even
of
her
sister
willoughby
he
whom
only
half
an
hour
ago
she
had
abhorred
as
the
most
worthless
of
men
willoughby
in
spite
of
all
his
faults
excited
a
degree
of
commiseration
for
the
sufferings
produced
by
them
which
made
her
think
of
him
as
now
separated
for
ever
from
her
family
with
a
tenderness
a
regret
rather
in
proportion
as
she
soon
acknowledged
within
herself
to
his
wishes
than
to
his
merits
she
felt
that
his
influence
over
her
mind
was
heightened
by
circumstances
which
ought
not
in
reason
to
have
weight
by
that
person
of
uncommon
attraction
that
open
affectionate
and
lively
manner
which
it
was
no
merit
to
possess
and
by
that
still
ardent
love
for
marianne
which
it
was
not
even
innocent
to
indulge
but
she
felt
that
it
was
so
long
long
before
she
could
feel
his
influence
less
when
at
last
she
returned
to
the
unconscious
marianne
she
found
her
just
awaking
refreshed
by
so
long
and
sweet
a
sleep
to
the
extent
of
her
hopes
elinor
s
heart
was
full
the
past
the
present
the
future
willoughby
s
visit
marianne
s
safety
and
her
mother
s
expected
arrival
threw
her
altogether
into
an
agitation
of
spirits
which
kept
off
every
indication
of
fatigue
and
made
her
only
fearful
of
betraying
herself
to
her
sister
short
was
the
time
however
in
which
that
fear
could
affect
her
for
within
half
an
hour
after
willoughby
s
leaving
the
house
she
was
again
called
down
stairs
by
the
sound
of
another
carriage
eager
to
save
her
mother
from
every
unnecessary
moment
s
horrible
suspense
she
ran
immediately
into
the
hall
and
reached
the
outward
door
just
in
time
to
receive
and
support
her
as
she
entered
it
mrs
dashwood
whose
terror
as
they
drew
near
the
house
had
produced
almost
the
conviction
of
marianne
s
being
no
more
had
no
voice
to
inquire
after
her
no
voice
even
for
elinor
but
she
waiting
neither
for
salutation
nor
inquiry
instantly
gave
the
joyful
relief
and
her
mother
catching
it
with
all
her
usual
warmth
was
in
a
moment
as
much
overcome
by
her
happiness
as
she
had
been
before
by
her
fears
she
was
supported
into
the
drawing
room
between
her
daughter
and
her
friend
and
there
shedding
tears
of
joy
though
still
unable
to
speak
embraced
elinor
again
and
again
turning
from
her
at
intervals
to
press
colonel
brandon
s
hand
with
a
look
which
spoke
at
once
her
gratitude
and
her
conviction
of
his
sharing
with
herself
in
the
bliss
of
the
moment
he
shared
it
however
in
a
silence
even
greater
than
her
own
as
soon
as
mrs
dashwood
had
recovered
herself
to
see
marianne
was
her
first
desire
and
in
two
minutes
she
was
with
her
beloved
child
rendered
dearer
to
her
than
ever
by
absence
unhappiness
and
danger
elinor
s
delight
as
she
saw
what
each
felt
in
the
meeting
was
only
checked
by
an
apprehension
of
its
robbing
marianne
of
farther
sleep
but
mrs
dashwood
could
be
calm
could
be
even
prudent
when
the
life
of
a
child
was
at
stake
and
marianne
satisfied
in
knowing
her
mother
was
near
her
and
conscious
of
being
too
weak
for
conversation
submitted
readily
to
the
silence
and
quiet
prescribed
by
every
nurse
around
her
mrs
dashwood
would
sit
up
with
her
all
night
and
elinor
in
compliance
with
her
mother
s
entreaty
went
to
bed
but
the
rest
which
one
night
entirely
sleepless
and
many
hours
of
the
most
wearing
anxiety
seemed
to
make
requisite
was
kept
off
by
irritation
of
spirits
willoughby
poor
willoughby
as
she
now
allowed
herself
to
call
him
was
constantly
in
her
thoughts
she
would
not
but
have
heard
his
vindication
for
the
world
and
now
blamed
now
acquitted
herself
for
having
judged
him
so
harshly
before
but
her
promise
of
relating
it
to
her
sister
was
invariably
painful
she
dreaded
the
performance
of
it
dreaded
what
its
effect
on
marianne
might
be
doubted
whether
after
such
an
explanation
she
could
ever
be
happy
with
another
and
for
a
moment
wished
willoughby
a
widower
then
remembering
colonel
brandon
reproved
herself
felt
that
to
his
sufferings
and
his
constancy
far
more
than
to
his
rival
s
the
reward
of
her
sister
was
due
and
wished
any
thing
rather
than
mrs
willoughby
s
death
the
shock
of
colonel
brandon
s
errand
at
barton
had
been
much
softened
to
mrs
dashwood
by
her
own
previous
alarm
for
so
great
was
her
uneasiness
about
marianne
that
she
had
already
determined
to
set
out
for
cleveland
on
that
very
day
without
waiting
for
any
further
intelligence
and
had
so
far
settled
her
journey
before
his
arrival
that
the
careys
were
then
expected
every
moment
to
fetch
margaret
away
as
her
mother
was
unwilling
to
take
her
where
there
might
be
infection
marianne
continued
to
mend
every
day
and
the
brilliant
cheerfulness
of
mrs
dashwood
s
looks
and
spirits
proved
her
to
be
as
she
repeatedly
declared
herself
one
of
the
happiest
women
in
the
world
elinor
could
not
hear
the
declaration
nor
witness
its
proofs
without
sometimes
wondering
whether
her
mother
ever
recollected
edward
but
mrs
dashwood
trusting
to
the
temperate
account
of
her
own
disappointment
which
elinor
had
sent
her
was
led
away
by
the
exuberance
of
her
joy
to
think
only
of
what
would
increase
it
marianne
was
restored
to
her
from
a
danger
in
which
as
she
now
began
to
feel
her
own
mistaken
judgment
in
encouraging
the
unfortunate
attachment
to
willoughby
had
contributed
to
place
her
and
in
her
recovery
she
had
yet
another
source
of
joy
unthought
of
by
elinor
it
was
thus
imparted
to
her
as
soon
as
any
opportunity
of
private
conference
between
them
occurred
at
last
we
are
alone
my
elinor
you
do
not
yet
know
all
my
happiness
colonel
brandon
loves
marianne
he
has
told
me
so
himself
her
daughter
feeling
by
turns
both
pleased
and
pained
surprised
and
not
surprised
was
all
silent
attention
you
are
never
like
me
dear
elinor
or
i
should
wonder
at
your
composure
now
had
i
sat
down
to
wish
for
any
possible
good
to
my
family
i
should
have
fixed
on
colonel
brandon
s
marrying
one
of
you
as
the
object
most
desirable
and
i
believe
marianne
will
be
the
most
happy
with
him
of
the
two
elinor
was
half
inclined
to
ask
her
reason
for
thinking
so
because
satisfied
that
none
founded
on
an
impartial
consideration
of
their
age
characters
or
feelings
could
be
given
but
her
mother
must
always
be
carried
away
by
her
imagination
on
any
interesting
subject
and
therefore
instead
of
an
inquiry
she
passed
it
off
with
a
smile
he
opened
his
whole
heart
to
me
yesterday
as
we
travelled
it
came
out
quite
unawares
quite
undesignedly
i
you
may
well
believe
could
talk
of
nothing
but
my
child
he
could
not
conceal
his
distress
i
saw
that
it
equalled
my
own
and
he
perhaps
thinking
that
mere
friendship
as
the
world
now
goes
would
not
justify
so
warm
a
sympathy
or
rather
not
thinking
at
all
i
suppose
giving
way
to
irresistible
feelings
made
me
acquainted
with
his
earnest
tender
constant
affection
for
marianne
he
has
loved
her
my
elinor
ever
since
the
first
moment
of
seeing
her
here
however
elinor
perceived
not
the
language
not
the
professions
of
colonel
brandon
but
the
natural
embellishments
of
her
mother
s
active
fancy
which
fashioned
every
thing
delightful
to
her
as
it
chose
his
regard
for
her
infinitely
surpassing
anything
that
willoughby
ever
felt
or
feigned
as
much
more
warm
as
more
sincere
or
constant
which
ever
we
are
to
call
it
has
subsisted
through
all
the
knowledge
of
dear
marianne
s
unhappy
prepossession
for
that
worthless
young
man
and
without
selfishness
without
encouraging
a
hope
could
he
have
seen
her
happy
with
another
such
a
noble
mind
such
openness
such
sincerity
no
one
can
be
deceived
in
him
colonel
brandon
s
character
said
elinor
as
an
excellent
man
is
well
established
i
know
it
is
replied
her
mother
seriously
or
after
such
a
warning
i
should
be
the
last
to
encourage
such
affection
or
even
to
be
pleased
by
it
but
his
coming
for
me
as
he
did
with
such
active
such
ready
friendship
is
enough
to
prove
him
one
of
the
worthiest
of
men
his
character
however
answered
elinor
does
not
rest
on
one
act
of
kindness
to
which
his
affection
for
marianne
were
humanity
out
of
the
case
would
have
prompted
him
to
mrs
jennings
to
the
middletons
he
has
been
long
and
intimately
known
they
equally
love
and
respect
him
and
even
my
own
knowledge
of
him
though
lately
acquired
is
very
considerable
and
so
highly
do
i
value
and
esteem
him
that
if
marianne
can
be
happy
with
him
i
shall
be
as
ready
as
yourself
to
think
our
connection
the
greatest
blessing
to
us
in
the
world
what
answer
did
you
give
him
did
you
allow
him
to
hope
oh
my
love
i
could
not
then
talk
of
hope
to
him
or
to
myself
marianne
might
at
that
moment
be
dying
but
he
did
not
ask
for
hope
or
encouragement
his
was
an
involuntary
confidence
an
irrepressible
effusion
to
a
soothing
friend
not
an
application
to
a
parent
yet
after
a
time
i
did
say
for
at
first
i
was
quite
overcome
that
if
she
lived
as
i
trusted
she
might
my
greatest
happiness
would
lie
in
promoting
their
marriage
and
since
our
arrival
since
our
delightful
security
i
have
repeated
it
to
him
more
fully
have
given
him
every
encouragement
in
my
power
time
a
very
little
time
i
tell
him
will
do
everything
marianne
s
heart
is
not
to
be
wasted
for
ever
on
such
a
man
as
willoughby
his
own
merits
must
soon
secure
it
to
judge
from
the
colonel
s
spirits
however
you
have
not
yet
made
him
equally
sanguine
no
he
thinks
marianne
s
affection
too
deeply
rooted
for
any
change
in
it
under
a
great
length
of
time
and
even
supposing
her
heart
again
free
is
too
diffident
of
himself
to
believe
that
with
such
a
difference
of
age
and
disposition
he
could
ever
attach
her
there
however
he
is
quite
mistaken
his
age
is
only
so
much
beyond
hers
as
to
be
an
advantage
as
to
make
his
character
and
principles
fixed
and
his
disposition
i
am
well
convinced
is
exactly
the
very
one
to
make
your
sister
happy
and
his
person
his
manners
too
are
all
in
his
favour
my
partiality
does
not
blind
me
he
certainly
is
not
so
handsome
as
willoughby
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
something
much
more
pleasing
in
his
countenance
there
was
always
a
something
if
you
remember
in
willoughby
s
eyes
at
times
which
i
did
not
like
elinor
could
not
remember
it
but
her
mother
without
waiting
for
her
assent
continued
and
his
manners
the
colonel
s
manners
are
not
only
more
pleasing
to
me
than
willoughby
s
ever
were
but
they
are
of
a
kind
i
well
know
to
be
more
solidly
attaching
to
marianne
their
gentleness
their
genuine
attention
to
other
people
and
their
manly
unstudied
simplicity
is
much
more
accordant
with
her
real
disposition
than
the
liveliness
often
artificial
and
often
ill
timed
of
the
other
i
am
very
sure
myself
that
had
willoughby
turned
out
as
really
amiable
as
he
has
proved
himself
the
contrary
marianne
would
yet
never
have
been
so
happy
with
him
as
she
will
be
with
colonel
brandon
she
paused
her
daughter
could
not
quite
agree
with
her
but
her
dissent
was
not
heard
and
therefore
gave
no
offence
at
delaford
she
will
be
within
an
easy
distance
of
me
added
mrs
dashwood
even
if
i
remain
at
barton
and
in
all
probability
for
i
hear
it
is
a
large
village
indeed
there
certainly
must
be
some
small
house
or
cottage
close
by
that
would
suit
us
quite
as
well
as
our
present
situation
poor
elinor
here
was
a
new
scheme
for
getting
her
to
delaford
but
her
spirit
was
stubborn
his
fortune
too
for
at
my
time
of
life
you
know
everybody
cares
about
that
and
though
i
neither
know
nor
desire
to
know
what
it
really
is
i
am
sure
it
must
be
a
good
one
here
they
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
third
person
and
elinor
withdrew
to
think
it
all
over
in
private
to
wish
success
to
her
friend
and
yet
in
wishing
it
to
feel
a
pang
for
willoughby
marianne
s
illness
though
weakening
in
its
kind
had
not
been
long
enough
to
make
her
recovery
slow
and
with
youth
natural
strength
and
her
mother
s
presence
in
aid
it
proceeded
so
smoothly
as
to
enable
her
to
remove
within
four
days
after
the
arrival
of
the
latter
into
mrs
palmer
s
dressing
room
when
there
at
her
own
particular
request
for
she
was
impatient
to
pour
forth
her
thanks
to
him
for
fetching
her
mother
colonel
brandon
was
invited
to
visit
her
his
emotion
on
entering
the
room
in
seeing
her
altered
looks
and
in
receiving
the
pale
hand
which
she
immediately
held
out
to
him
was
such
as
in
elinor
s
conjecture
must
arise
from
something
more
than
his
affection
for
marianne
or
the
consciousness
of
its
being
known
to
others
and
she
soon
discovered
in
his
melancholy
eye
and
varying
complexion
as
he
looked
at
her
sister
the
probable
recurrence
of
many
past
scenes
of
misery
to
his
mind
brought
back
by
that
resemblance
between
marianne
and
eliza
already
acknowledged
and
now
strengthened
by
the
hollow
eye
the
sickly
skin
the
posture
of
reclining
weakness
and
the
warm
acknowledgment
of
peculiar
obligation
mrs
dashwood
not
less
watchful
of
what
passed
than
her
daughter
but
with
a
mind
very
differently
influenced
and
therefore
watching
to
very
different
effect
saw
nothing
in
the
colonel
s
behaviour
but
what
arose
from
the
most
simple
and
self
evident
sensations
while
in
the
actions
and
words
of
marianne
she
persuaded
herself
to
think
that
something
more
than
gratitude
already
dawned
at
the
end
of
another
day
or
two
marianne
growing
visibly
stronger
every
twelve
hours
mrs
dashwood
urged
equally
by
her
own
and
her
daughter
s
wishes
began
to
talk
of
removing
to
barton
on
her
measures
depended
those
of
her
two
friends
mrs
jennings
could
not
quit
cleveland
during
the
dashwoods
stay
and
colonel
brandon
was
soon
brought
by
their
united
request
to
consider
his
own
abode
there
as
equally
determinate
if
not
equally
indispensable
at
his
and
mrs
jennings
s
united
request
in
return
mrs
dashwood
was
prevailed
on
to
accept
the
use
of
his
carriage
on
her
journey
back
for
the
better
accommodation
of
her
sick
child
and
the
colonel
at
the
joint
invitation
of
mrs
dashwood
and
mrs
jennings
whose
active
good
nature
made
her
friendly
and
hospitable
for
other
people
as
well
as
herself
engaged
with
pleasure
to
redeem
it
by
a
visit
at
the
cottage
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
the
day
of
separation
and
departure
arrived
and
marianne
after
taking
so
particular
and
lengthened
a
leave
of
mrs
jennings
one
so
earnestly
grateful
so
full
of
respect
and
kind
wishes
as
seemed
due
to
her
own
heart
from
a
secret
acknowledgment
of
past
inattention
and
bidding
colonel
brandon
farewell
with
a
cordiality
of
a
friend
was
carefully
assisted
by
him
into
the
carriage
of
which
he
seemed
anxious
that
she
should
engross
at
least
half
mrs
dashwood
and
elinor
then
followed
and
the
others
were
left
by
themselves
to
talk
of
the
travellers
and
feel
their
own
dullness
till
mrs
jennings
was
summoned
to
her
chaise
to
take
comfort
in
the
gossip
of
her
maid
for
the
loss
of
her
two
young
companions
and
colonel
brandon
immediately
afterwards
took
his
solitary
way
to
delaford
the
dashwoods
were
two
days
on
the
road
and
marianne
bore
her
journey
on
both
without
essential
fatigue
every
thing
that
the
most
zealous
affection
the
most
solicitous
care
could
do
to
render
her
comfortable
was
the
office
of
each
watchful
companion
and
each
found
their
reward
in
her
bodily
ease
and
her
calmness
of
spirits
to
elinor
the
observation
of
the
latter
was
particularly
grateful
she
who
had
seen
her
week
after
week
so
constantly
suffering
oppressed
by
anguish
of
heart
which
she
had
neither
courage
to
speak
of
nor
fortitude
to
conceal
now
saw
with
a
joy
which
no
other
could
equally
share
an
apparent
composure
of
mind
which
in
being
the
result
as
she
trusted
of
serious
reflection
must
eventually
lead
her
to
contentment
and
cheerfulness
as
they
approached
barton
indeed
and
entered
on
scenes
of
which
every
field
and
every
tree
brought
some
peculiar
some
painful
recollection
she
grew
silent
and
thoughtful
and
turning
away
her
face
from
their
notice
sat
earnestly
gazing
through
the
window
but
here
elinor
could
neither
wonder
nor
blame
and
when
she
saw
as
she
assisted
marianne
from
the
carriage
that
she
had
been
crying
she
saw
only
an
emotion
too
natural
in
itself
to
raise
any
thing
less
tender
than
pity
and
in
its
unobtrusiveness
entitled
to
praise
in
the
whole
of
her
subsequent
manner
she
traced
the
direction
of
a
mind
awakened
to
reasonable
exertion
for
no
sooner
had
they
entered
their
common
sitting
room
than
marianne
turned
her
eyes
around
it
with
a
look
of
resolute
firmness
as
if
determined
at
once
to
accustom
herself
to
the
sight
of
every
object
with
which
the
remembrance
of
willoughby
could
be
connected
she
said
little
but
every
sentence
aimed
at
cheerfulness
and
though
a
sigh
sometimes
escaped
her
it
never
passed
away
without
the
atonement
of
a
smile
after
dinner
she
would
try
her
piano
forte
she
went
to
it
but
the
music
on
which
her
eye
first
rested
was
an
opera
procured
for
her
by
willoughby
containing
some
of
their
favourite
duets
and
bearing
on
its
outward
leaf
her
own
name
in
his
hand
writing
that
would
not
do
she
shook
her
head
put
the
music
aside
and
after
running
over
the
keys
for
a
minute
complained
of
feebleness
in
her
fingers
and
closed
the
instrument
again
declaring
however
with
firmness
as
she
did
so
that
she
should
in
future
practice
much
the
next
morning
produced
no
abatement
in
these
happy
symptoms
on
the
contrary
with
a
mind
and
body
alike
strengthened
by
rest
she
looked
and
spoke
with
more
genuine
spirit
anticipating
the
pleasure
of
margaret
s
return
and
talking
of
the
dear
family
party
which
would
then
be
restored
of
their
mutual
pursuits
and
cheerful
society
as
the
only
happiness
worth
a
wish
when
the
weather
is
settled
and
i
have
recovered
my
strength
said
she
we
will
take
long
walks
together
every
day
we
will
walk
to
the
farm
at
the
edge
of
the
down
and
see
how
the
children
go
on
we
will
walk
to
sir
john
s
new
plantations
at
barton
cross
and
the
abbeyland
and
we
will
often
go
to
the
old
ruins
of
the
priory
and
try
to
trace
its
foundations
as
far
as
we
are
told
they
once
reached
i
know
we
shall
be
happy
i
know
the
summer
will
pass
happily
away
i
mean
never
to
be
later
in
rising
than
six
and
from
that
time
till
dinner
i
shall
divide
every
moment
between
music
and
reading
i
have
formed
my
plan
and
am
determined
to
enter
on
a
course
of
serious
study
our
own
library
is
too
well
known
to
me
to
be
resorted
to
for
any
thing
beyond
mere
amusement
but
there
are
many
works
well
worth
reading
at
the
park
and
there
are
others
of
more
modern
production
which
i
know
i
can
borrow
of
colonel
brandon
by
reading
only
six
hours
a
day
i
shall
gain
in
the
course
of
a
twelve
month
a
great
deal
of
instruction
which
i
now
feel
myself
to
want
elinor
honoured
her
for
a
plan
which
originated
so
nobly
as
this
though
smiling
to
see
the
same
eager
fancy
which
had
been
leading
her
to
the
extreme
of
languid
indolence
and
selfish
repining
now
at
work
in
introducing
excess
into
a
scheme
of
such
rational
employment
and
virtuous
self
control
her
smile
however
changed
to
a
sigh
when
she
remembered
that
promise
to
willoughby
was
yet
unfulfilled
and
feared
she
had
that
to
communicate
which
might
again
unsettle
the
mind
of
marianne
and
ruin
at
least
for
a
time
this
fair
prospect
of
busy
tranquillity
willing
therefore
to
delay
the
evil
hour
she
resolved
to
wait
till
her
sister
s
health
were
more
secure
before
she
appointed
it
but
the
resolution
was
made
only
to
be
broken
marianne
had
been
two
or
three
days
at
home
before
the
weather
was
fine
enough
for
an
invalid
like
herself
to
venture
out
but
at
last
a
soft
genial
morning
appeared
such
as
might
tempt
the
daughter
s
wishes
and
the
mother
s
confidence
and
marianne
leaning
on
elinor
s
arm
was
authorised
to
walk
as
long
as
she
could
without
fatigue
in
the
lane
before
the
house
the
sisters
set
out
at
a
pace
slow
as
the
feebleness
of
marianne
in
an
exercise
hitherto
untried
since
her
illness
required
and
they
had
advanced
only
so
far
beyond
the
house
as
to
admit
a
full
view
of
the
hill
the
important
hill
behind
when
pausing
with
her
eyes
turned
towards
it
marianne
calmly
said
there
exactly
there
pointing
with
one
hand
on
that
projecting
mound
there
i
fell
and
there
i
first
saw
willoughby
her
voice
sunk
with
the
word
but
presently
reviving
she
added
i
am
thankful
to
find
that
i
can
look
with
so
little
pain
on
the
spot
shall
we
ever
talk
on
that
subject
elinor
hesitatingly
it
was
said
or
will
it
be
wrong
i
can
talk
of
it
now
i
hope
as
i
ought
to
do
elinor
tenderly
invited
her
to
be
open
as
for
regret
said
marianne
i
have
done
with
that
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
i
do
not
mean
to
talk
to
you
of
what
my
feelings
have
been
for
him
but
what
they
are
now
at
present
if
i
could
be
satisfied
on
one
point
if
i
could
be
allowed
to
think
that
he
was
not
always
acting
a
part
not
always
deceiving
me
but
above
all
if
i
could
be
assured
that
he
never
was
so
very
wicked
as
my
fears
have
sometimes
fancied
him
since
the
story
of
that
unfortunate
girl
she
stopt
elinor
joyfully
treasured
her
words
as
she
answered
if
you
could
be
assured
of
that
you
think
you
should
be
easy
yes
my
peace
of
mind
is
doubly
involved
in
it
for
not
only
is
it
horrible
to
suspect
a
person
who
has
been
what
he
has
been
to
me
of
such
designs
but
what
must
it
make
me
appear
to
myself
what
in
a
situation
like
mine
but
a
most
shamefully
unguarded
affection
could
expose
me
to
how
then
asked
her
sister
would
you
account
for
his
behaviour
i
would
suppose
him
oh
how
gladly
would
i
suppose
him
only
fickle
very
very
fickle
elinor
said
no
more
she
was
debating
within
herself
on
the
eligibility
of
beginning
her
story
directly
or
postponing
it
till
marianne
were
in
stronger
health
and
they
crept
on
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
i
am
not
wishing
him
too
much
good
said
marianne
at
last
with
a
sigh
when
i
wish
his
secret
reflections
may
be
no
more
unpleasant
than
my
own
he
will
suffer
enough
in
them
do
you
compare
your
conduct
with
his
no
i
compare
it
with
what
it
ought
to
have
been
i
compare
it
with
yours
our
situations
have
borne
little
resemblance
they
have
borne
more
than
our
conduct
do
not
my
dearest
elinor
let
your
kindness
defend
what
i
know
your
judgment
must
censure
my
illness
has
made
me
think
it
has
given
me
leisure
and
calmness
for
serious
recollection
long
before
i
was
enough
recovered
to
talk
i
was
perfectly
able
to
reflect
i
considered
the
past
i
saw
in
my
own
behaviour
since
the
beginning
of
our
acquaintance
with
him
last
autumn
nothing
but
a
series
of
imprudence
towards
myself
and
want
of
kindness
to
others
i
saw
that
my
own
feelings
had
prepared
my
sufferings
and
that
my
want
of
fortitude
under
them
had
almost
led
me
to
the
grave
my
illness
i
well
knew
had
been
entirely
brought
on
by
myself
by
such
negligence
of
my
own
health
as
i
had
felt
even
at
the
time
to
be
wrong
had
i
died
it
would
have
been
self
destruction
i
did
not
know
my
danger
till
the
danger
was
removed
but
with
such
feelings
as
these
reflections
gave
me
i
wonder
at
my
recovery
wonder
that
the
very
eagerness
of
my
desire
to
live
to
have
time
for
atonement
to
my
god
and
to
you
all
did
not
kill
me
at
once
had
i
died
in
what
peculiar
misery
should
i
have
left
you
my
nurse
my
friend
my
sister
you
who
had
seen
all
the
fretful
selfishness
of
my
latter
days
who
had
known
all
the
murmurings
of
my
heart
how
should
i
have
lived
in
your
remembrance
my
mother
too
how
could
you
have
consoled
her
i
cannot
express
my
own
abhorrence
of
myself
whenever
i
looked
towards
the
past
i
saw
some
duty
neglected
or
some
failing
indulged
every
body
seemed
injured
by
me
the
kindness
the
unceasing
kindness
of
mrs
jennings
i
had
repaid
with
ungrateful
contempt
to
the
middletons
to
the
palmers
the
steeles
to
every
common
acquaintance
even
i
had
been
insolent
and
unjust
with
a
heart
hardened
against
their
merits
and
a
temper
irritated
by
their
very
attention
to
john
to
fanny
yes
even
to
them
little
as
they
deserve
i
had
given
less
than
their
due
but
you
you
above
all
above
my
mother
had
been
wronged
by
me
i
and
only
i
knew
your
heart
and
its
sorrows
yet
to
what
did
it
influence
me
not
to
any
compassion
that
could
benefit
you
or
myself
your
example
was
before
me
but
to
what
avail
was
i
more
considerate
of
you
and
your
comfort
did
i
imitate
your
forbearance
or
lessen
your
restraints
by
taking
any
part
in
those
offices
of
general
complaisance
or
particular
gratitude
which
you
had
hitherto
been
left
to
discharge
alone
no
not
less
when
i
knew
you
to
be
unhappy
than
when
i
had
believed
you
at
ease
did
i
turn
away
from
every
exertion
of
duty
or
friendship
scarcely
allowing
sorrow
to
exist
but
with
me
regretting
only
that
heart
which
had
deserted
and
wronged
me
and
leaving
you
for
whom
i
professed
an
unbounded
affection
to
be
miserable
for
my
sake
here
ceased
the
rapid
flow
of
her
self
reproving
spirit
and
elinor
impatient
to
soothe
though
too
honest
to
flatter
gave
her
instantly
that
praise
and
support
which
her
frankness
and
her
contrition
so
well
deserved
marianne
pressed
her
hand
and
replied
you
are
very
good
the
future
must
be
my
proof
i
have
laid
down
my
plan
and
if
i
am
capable
of
adhering
to
it
my
feelings
shall
be
governed
and
my
temper
improved
they
shall
no
longer
worry
others
nor
torture
myself
i
shall
now
live
solely
for
my
family
you
my
mother
and
margaret
must
henceforth
be
all
the
world
to
me
you
will
share
my
affections
entirely
between
you
from
you
from
my
home
i
shall
never
again
have
the
smallest
incitement
to
move
and
if
i
do
mix
in
other
society
it
will
be
only
to
shew
that
my
spirit
is
humbled
my
heart
amended
and
that
i
can
practise
the
civilities
the
lesser
duties
of
life
with
gentleness
and
forbearance
as
for
willoughby
to
say
that
i
shall
soon
or
that
i
shall
ever
forget
him
would
be
idle
his
remembrance
can
be
overcome
by
no
change
of
circumstances
or
opinions
but
it
shall
be
regulated
it
shall
be
checked
by
religion
by
reason
by
constant
employment
she
paused
and
added
in
a
low
voice
if
i
could
but
know
his
heart
everything
would
become
easy
elinor
who
had
now
been
for
some
time
reflecting
on
the
propriety
or
impropriety
of
speedily
hazarding
her
narration
without
feeling
at
all
nearer
decision
than
at
first
heard
this
and
perceiving
that
as
reflection
did
nothing
resolution
must
do
all
soon
found
herself
leading
to
the
fact
she
managed
the
recital
as
she
hoped
with
address
prepared
her
anxious
listener
with
caution
related
simply
and
honestly
the
chief
points
on
which
willoughby
grounded
his
apology
did
justice
to
his
repentance
and
softened
only
his
protestations
of
present
regard
marianne
said
not
a
word
she
trembled
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
and
her
lips
became
whiter
than
even
sickness
had
left
them
a
thousand
inquiries
sprung
up
from
her
heart
but
she
dared
not
urge
one
she
caught
every
syllable
with
panting
eagerness
her
hand
unknowingly
to
herself
closely
pressed
her
sister
s
and
tears
covered
her
cheeks
elinor
dreading
her
being
tired
led
her
towards
home
and
till
they
reached
the
door
of
the
cottage
easily
conjecturing
what
her
curiosity
must
be
though
no
question
was
suffered
to
speak
it
talked
of
nothing
but
willoughby
and
their
conversation
together
and
was
carefully
minute
in
every
particular
of
speech
and
look
where
minuteness
could
be
safely
indulged
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
house
marianne
with
a
kiss
of
gratitude
and
these
two
words
just
articulate
through
her
tears
tell
mama
withdrew
from
her
sister
and
walked
slowly
up
stairs
elinor
would
not
attempt
to
disturb
a
solitude
so
reasonable
as
what
she
now
sought
and
with
a
mind
anxiously
pre
arranging
its
result
and
a
resolution
of
reviving
the
subject
again
should
marianne
fail
to
do
it
she
turned
into
the
parlour
to
fulfill
her
parting
injunction
mrs
dashwood
did
not
hear
unmoved
the
vindication
of
her
former
favourite
she
rejoiced
in
his
being
cleared
from
some
part
of
his
imputed
guilt
she
was
sorry
for
him
she
wished
him
happy
but
the
feelings
of
the
past
could
not
be
recalled
nothing
could
restore
him
with
a
faith
unbroken
a
character
unblemished
to
marianne
nothing
could
do
away
the
knowledge
of
what
the
latter
had
suffered
through
his
means
nor
remove
the
guilt
of
his
conduct
towards
eliza
nothing
could
replace
him
therefore
in
her
former
esteem
nor
injure
the
interests
of
colonel
brandon
had
mrs
dashwood
like
her
daughter
heard
willoughby
s
story
from
himself
had
she
witnessed
his
distress
and
been
under
the
influence
of
his
countenance
and
his
manner
it
is
probable
that
her
compassion
would
have
been
greater
but
it
was
neither
in
elinor
s
power
nor
in
her
wish
to
rouse
such
feelings
in
another
by
her
retailed
explanation
as
had
at
first
been
called
forth
in
herself
reflection
had
given
calmness
to
her
judgment
and
sobered
her
own
opinion
of
willoughby
s
deserts
she
wished
therefore
to
declare
only
the
simple
truth
and
lay
open
such
facts
as
were
really
due
to
his
character
without
any
embellishment
of
tenderness
to
lead
the
fancy
astray
in
the
evening
when
they
were
all
three
together
marianne
began
voluntarily
to
speak
of
him
again
but
that
it
was
not
without
an
effort
the
restless
unquiet
thoughtfulness
in
which
she
had
been
for
some
time
previously
sitting
her
rising
colour
as
she
spoke
and
her
unsteady
voice
plainly
shewed
i
wish
to
assure
you
both
said
she
that
i
see
every
thing
as
you
can
desire
me
to
do
mrs
dashwood
would
have
interrupted
her
instantly
with
soothing
tenderness
had
not
elinor
who
really
wished
to
hear
her
sister
s
unbiased
opinion
by
an
eager
sign
engaged
her
silence
marianne
slowly
continued
it
is
a
great
relief
to
me
what
elinor
told
me
this
morning
i
have
now
heard
exactly
what
i
wished
to
hear
for
some
moments
her
voice
was
lost
but
recovering
herself
she
added
and
with
greater
calmness
than
before
i
am
now
perfectly
satisfied
i
wish
for
no
change
i
never
could
have
been
happy
with
him
after
knowing
as
sooner
or
later
i
must
have
known
all
this
i
should
have
had
no
confidence
no
esteem
nothing
could
have
done
it
away
to
my
feelings
i
know
it
i
know
it
cried
her
mother
happy
with
a
man
of
libertine
practices
with
one
who
so
injured
the
peace
of
the
dearest
of
our
friends
and
the
best
of
men
no
my
marianne
has
not
a
heart
to
be
made
happy
with
such
a
man
her
conscience
her
sensitive
conscience
would
have
felt
all
that
the
conscience
of
her
husband
ought
to
have
felt
marianne
sighed
and
repeated
i
wish
for
no
change
you
consider
the
matter
said
elinor
exactly
as
a
good
mind
and
a
sound
understanding
must
consider
it
and
i
dare
say
you
perceive
as
well
as
myself
not
only
in
this
but
in
many
other
circumstances
reason
enough
to
be
convinced
that
your
marriage
must
have
involved
you
in
many
certain
troubles
and
disappointments
in
which
you
would
have
been
poorly
supported
by
an
affection
on
his
side
much
less
certain
had
you
married
you
must
have
been
always
poor
his
expensiveness
is
acknowledged
even
by
himself
and
his
whole
conduct
declares
that
self
denial
is
a
word
hardly
understood
by
him
his
demands
and
your
inexperience
together
on
a
small
very
small
income
must
have
brought
on
distresses
which
would
not
be
the
less
grievous
to
you
from
having
been
entirely
unknown
and
unthought
of
before
your
sense
of
honour
and
honesty
would
have
led
you
i
know
when
aware
of
your
situation
to
attempt
all
the
economy
that
would
appear
to
you
possible
and
perhaps
as
long
as
your
frugality
retrenched
only
on
your
own
comfort
you
might
have
been
suffered
to
practice
it
but
beyond
that
and
how
little
could
the
utmost
of
your
single
management
do
to
stop
the
ruin
which
had
begun
before
your
marriage
beyond
that
had
you
endeavoured
however
reasonably
to
abridge
his
enjoyments
is
it
not
to
be
feared
that
instead
of
prevailing
on
feelings
so
selfish
to
consent
to
it
you
would
have
lessened
your
own
influence
on
his
heart
and
made
him
regret
the
connection
which
had
involved
him
in
such
difficulties
marianne
s
lips
quivered
and
she
repeated
the
word
selfish
in
a
tone
that
implied
do
you
really
think
him
selfish
the
whole
of
his
behaviour
replied
elinor
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
affair
has
been
grounded
on
selfishness
it
was
selfishness
which
first
made
him
sport
with
your
affections
which
afterwards
when
his
own
were
engaged
made
him
delay
the
confession
of
it
and
which
finally
carried
him
from
barton
his
own
enjoyment
or
his
own
ease
was
in
every
particular
his
ruling
principle
it
is
very
true
my
happiness
never
was
his
object
at
present
continued
elinor
he
regrets
what
he
has
done
and
why
does
he
regret
it
because
he
finds
it
has
not
answered
towards
himself
it
has
not
made
him
happy
his
circumstances
are
now
unembarrassed
he
suffers
from
no
evil
of
that
kind
and
he
thinks
only
that
he
has
married
a
woman
of
a
less
amiable
temper
than
yourself
but
does
it
follow
that
had
he
married
you
he
would
have
been
happy
the
inconveniences
would
have
been
different
he
would
then
have
suffered
under
the
pecuniary
distresses
which
because
they
are
removed
he
now
reckons
as
nothing
he
would
have
had
a
wife
of
whose
temper
he
could
make
no
complaint
but
he
would
have
been
always
necessitous
always
poor
and
probably
would
soon
have
learned
to
rank
the
innumerable
comforts
of
a
clear
estate
and
good
income
as
of
far
more
importance
even
to
domestic
happiness
than
the
mere
temper
of
a
wife
i
have
not
a
doubt
of
it
said
marianne
and
i
have
nothing
to
regret
nothing
but
my
own
folly
rather
say
your
mother
s
imprudence
my
child
said
mrs
dashwood
she
must
be
answerable
marianne
would
not
let
her
proceed
and
elinor
satisfied
that
each
felt
their
own
error
wished
to
avoid
any
survey
of
the
past
that
might
weaken
her
sister
s
spirits
she
therefore
pursuing
the
first
subject
immediately
continued
one
observation
may
i
think
be
fairly
drawn
from
the
whole
of
the
story
that
all
willoughby
s
difficulties
have
arisen
from
the
first
offence
against
virtue
in
his
behaviour
to
eliza
williams
that
crime
has
been
the
origin
of
every
lesser
one
and
of
all
his
present
discontents
marianne
assented
most
feelingly
to
the
remark
and
her
mother
was
led
by
it
to
an
enumeration
of
colonel
brandon
s
injuries
and
merits
warm
as
friendship
and
design
could
unitedly
dictate
her
daughter
did
not
look
however
as
if
much
of
it
were
heard
by
her
elinor
according
to
her
expectation
saw
on
the
two
or
three
following
days
that
marianne
did
not
continue
to
gain
strength
as
she
had
done
but
while
her
resolution
was
unsubdued
and
she
still
tried
to
appear
cheerful
and
easy
her
sister
could
safely
trust
to
the
effect
of
time
upon
her
health
margaret
returned
and
the
family
were
again
all
restored
to
each
other
again
quietly
settled
at
the
cottage
and
if
not
pursuing
their
usual
studies
with
quite
so
much
vigour
as
when
they
first
came
to
barton
at
least
planning
a
vigorous
prosecution
of
them
in
future
elinor
grew
impatient
for
some
tidings
of
edward
she
had
heard
nothing
of
him
since
her
leaving
london
nothing
new
of
his
plans
nothing
certain
even
of
his
present
abode
some
letters
had
passed
between
her
and
her
brother
in
consequence
of
marianne
s
illness
and
in
the
first
of
john
s
there
had
been
this
sentence
we
know
nothing
of
our
unfortunate
edward
and
can
make
no
enquiries
on
so
prohibited
a
subject
but
conclude
him
to
be
still
at
oxford
which
was
all
the
intelligence
of
edward
afforded
her
by
the
correspondence
for
his
name
was
not
even
mentioned
in
any
of
the
succeeding
letters
she
was
not
doomed
however
to
be
long
in
ignorance
of
his
measures
their
man
servant
had
been
sent
one
morning
to
exeter
on
business
and
when
as
he
waited
at
table
he
had
satisfied
the
inquiries
of
his
mistress
as
to
the
event
of
his
errand
this
was
his
voluntary
communication
i
suppose
you
know
ma
am
that
mr
ferrars
is
married
marianne
gave
a
violent
start
fixed
her
eyes
upon
elinor
saw
her
turning
pale
and
fell
back
in
her
chair
in
hysterics
mrs
dashwood
whose
eyes
as
she
answered
the
servant
s
inquiry
had
intuitively
taken
the
same
direction
was
shocked
to
perceive
by
elinor
s
countenance
how
much
she
really
suffered
and
a
moment
afterwards
alike
distressed
by
marianne
s
situation
knew
not
on
which
child
to
bestow
her
principal
attention
the
servant
who
saw
only
that
miss
marianne
was
taken
ill
had
sense
enough
to
call
one
of
the
maids
who
with
mrs
dashwood
s
assistance
supported
her
into
the
other
room
by
that
time
marianne
was
rather
better
and
her
mother
leaving
her
to
the
care
of
margaret
and
the
maid
returned
to
elinor
who
though
still
much
disordered
had
so
far
recovered
the
use
of
her
reason
and
voice
as
to
be
just
beginning
an
inquiry
of
thomas
as
to
the
source
of
his
intelligence
mrs
dashwood
immediately
took
all
that
trouble
on
herself
and
elinor
had
the
benefit
of
the
information
without
the
exertion
of
seeking
it
who
told
you
that
mr
ferrars
was
married
thomas
i
see
mr
ferrars
myself
ma
am
this
morning
in
exeter
and
his
lady
too
miss
steele
as
was
they
was
stopping
in
a
chaise
at
the
door
of
the
new
london
inn
as
i
went
there
with
a
message
from
sally
at
the
park
to
her
brother
who
is
one
of
the
post
boys
i
happened
to
look
up
as
i
went
by
the
chaise
and
so
i
see
directly
it
was
the
youngest
miss
steele
so
i
took
off
my
hat
and
she
knew
me
and
called
to
me
and
inquired
after
you
ma
am
and
the
young
ladies
especially
miss
marianne
and
bid
me
i
should
give
her
compliments
and
mr
ferrars
s
their
best
compliments
and
service
and
how
sorry
they
was
they
had
not
time
to
come
on
and
see
you
but
they
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
go
forwards
for
they
was
going
further
down
for
a
little
while
but
howsever
when
they
come
back
they
d
make
sure
to
come
and
see
you
but
did
she
tell
you
she
was
married
thomas
yes
ma
am
she
smiled
and
said
how
she
had
changed
her
name
since
she
was
in
these
parts
she
was
always
a
very
affable
and
free
spoken
young
lady
and
very
civil
behaved
so
i
made
free
to
wish
her
joy
was
mr
ferrars
in
the
carriage
with
her
yes
ma
am
i
just
see
him
leaning
back
in
it
but
he
did
not
look
up
he
never
was
a
gentleman
much
for
talking
elinor
s
heart
could
easily
account
for
his
not
putting
himself
forward
and
mrs
dashwood
probably
found
the
same
explanation
was
there
no
one
else
in
the
carriage
no
ma
am
only
they
two
do
you
know
where
they
came
from
they
come
straight
from
town
as
miss
lucy
mrs
ferrars
told
me
and
are
they
going
farther
westward
yes
ma
am
but
not
to
bide
long
they
will
soon
be
back
again
and
then
they
d
be
sure
and
call
here
mrs
dashwood
now
looked
at
her
daughter
but
elinor
knew
better
than
to
expect
them
she
recognised
the
whole
of
lucy
in
the
message
and
was
very
confident
that
edward
would
never
come
near
them
she
observed
in
a
low
voice
to
her
mother
that
they
were
probably
going
down
to
mr
pratt
s
near
plymouth
thomas
s
intelligence
seemed
over
elinor
looked
as
if
she
wished
to
hear
more
did
you
see
them
off
before
you
came
away
no
ma
am
the
horses
were
just
coming
out
but
i
could
not
bide
any
longer
i
was
afraid
of
being
late
did
mrs
ferrars
look
well
yes
ma
am
she
said
how
she
was
very
well
and
to
my
mind
she
was
always
a
very
handsome
young
lady
and
she
seemed
vastly
contented
mrs
dashwood
could
think
of
no
other
question
and
thomas
and
the
tablecloth
now
alike
needless
were
soon
afterwards
dismissed
marianne
had
already
sent
to
say
that
she
should
eat
nothing
more
mrs
dashwood
s
and
elinor
s
appetites
were
equally
lost
and
margaret
might
think
herself
very
well
off
that
with
so
much
uneasiness
as
both
her
sisters
had
lately
experienced
so
much
reason
as
they
had
often
had
to
be
careless
of
their
meals
she
had
never
been
obliged
to
go
without
her
dinner
before
when
the
dessert
and
the
wine
were
arranged
and
mrs
dashwood
and
elinor
were
left
by
themselves
they
remained
long
together
in
a
similarity
of
thoughtfulness
and
silence
mrs
dashwood
feared
to
hazard
any
remark
and
ventured
not
to
offer
consolation
she
now
found
that
she
had
erred
in
relying
on
elinor
s
representation
of
herself
and
justly
concluded
that
every
thing
had
been
expressly
softened
at
the
time
to
spare
her
from
an
increase
of
unhappiness
suffering
as
she
then
had
suffered
for
marianne
she
found
that
she
had
been
misled
by
the
careful
the
considerate
attention
of
her
daughter
to
think
the
attachment
which
once
she
had
so
well
understood
much
slighter
in
reality
than
she
had
been
wont
to
believe
or
than
it
was
now
proved
to
be
she
feared
that
under
this
persuasion
she
had
been
unjust
inattentive
nay
almost
unkind
to
her
elinor
that
marianne
s
affliction
because
more
acknowledged
more
immediately
before
her
had
too
much
engrossed
her
tenderness
and
led
her
away
to
forget
that
in
elinor
she
might
have
a
daughter
suffering
almost
as
much
certainly
with
less
self
provocation
and
greater
fortitude
elinor
now
found
the
difference
between
the
expectation
of
an
unpleasant
event
however
certain
the
mind
may
be
told
to
consider
it
and
certainty
itself
she
now
found
that
in
spite
of
herself
she
had
always
admitted
a
hope
while
edward
remained
single
that
something
would
occur
to
prevent
his
marrying
lucy
that
some
resolution
of
his
own
some
mediation
of
friends
or
some
more
eligible
opportunity
of
establishment
for
the
lady
would
arise
to
assist
the
happiness
of
all
but
he
was
now
married
and
she
condemned
her
heart
for
the
lurking
flattery
which
so
much
heightened
the
pain
of
the
intelligence
that
he
should
be
married
soon
before
as
she
imagined
he
could
be
in
orders
and
consequently
before
he
could
be
in
possession
of
the
living
surprised
her
a
little
at
first
but
she
soon
saw
how
likely
it
was
that
lucy
in
her
self
provident
care
in
her
haste
to
secure
him
should
overlook
every
thing
but
the
risk
of
delay
they
were
married
married
in
town
and
now
hastening
down
to
her
uncle
s
what
had
edward
felt
on
being
within
four
miles
from
barton
on
seeing
her
mother
s
servant
on
hearing
lucy
s
message
they
would
soon
she
supposed
be
settled
at
delaford
delaford
that
place
in
which
so
much
conspired
to
give
her
an
interest
which
she
wished
to
be
acquainted
with
and
yet
desired
to
avoid
she
saw
them
in
an
instant
in
their
parsonage
house
saw
in
lucy
the
active
contriving
manager
uniting
at
once
a
desire
of
smart
appearance
with
the
utmost
frugality
and
ashamed
to
be
suspected
of
half
her
economical
practices
pursuing
her
own
interest
in
every
thought
courting
the
favour
of
colonel
brandon
of
mrs
jennings
and
of
every
wealthy
friend
in
edward
she
knew
not
what
she
saw
nor
what
she
wished
to
see
happy
or
unhappy
nothing
pleased
her
she
turned
away
her
head
from
every
sketch
of
him
elinor
flattered
herself
that
some
one
of
their
connections
in
london
would
write
to
them
to
announce
the
event
and
give
farther
particulars
but
day
after
day
passed
off
and
brought
no
letter
no
tidings
though
uncertain
that
any
one
were
to
blame
she
found
fault
with
every
absent
friend
they
were
all
thoughtless
or
indolent
when
do
you
write
to
colonel
brandon
ma
am
was
an
inquiry
which
sprung
from
the
impatience
of
her
mind
to
have
something
going
on
i
wrote
to
him
my
love
last
week
and
rather
expect
to
see
than
to
hear
from
him
again
i
earnestly
pressed
his
coming
to
us
and
should
not
be
surprised
to
see
him
walk
in
today
or
tomorrow
or
any
day
this
was
gaining
something
something
to
look
forward
to
colonel
brandon
must
have
some
information
to
give
scarcely
had
she
so
determined
it
when
the
figure
of
a
man
on
horseback
drew
her
eyes
to
the
window
he
stopt
at
their
gate
it
was
a
gentleman
it
was
colonel
brandon
himself
now
she
could
hear
more
and
she
trembled
in
expectation
of
it
but
it
was
not
colonel
brandon
neither
his
air
nor
his
height
were
it
possible
she
must
say
it
must
be
edward
she
looked
again
he
had
just
dismounted
she
could
not
be
mistaken
it
was
edward
she
moved
away
and
sat
down
he
comes
from
mr
pratt
s
purposely
to
see
us
i
will
be
calm
i
will
be
mistress
of
myself
in
a
moment
she
perceived
that
the
others
were
likewise
aware
of
the
mistake
she
saw
her
mother
and
marianne
change
colour
saw
them
look
at
herself
and
whisper
a
few
sentences
to
each
other
she
would
have
given
the
world
to
be
able
to
speak
and
to
make
them
understand
that
she
hoped
no
coolness
no
slight
would
appear
in
their
behaviour
to
him
but
she
had
no
utterance
and
was
obliged
to
leave
all
to
their
own
discretion
not
a
syllable
passed
aloud
they
all
waited
in
silence
for
the
appearance
of
their
visitor
his
footsteps
were
heard
along
the
gravel
path
in
a
moment
he
was
in
the
passage
and
in
another
he
was
before
them
his
countenance
as
he
entered
the
room
was
not
too
happy
even
for
elinor
his
complexion
was
white
with
agitation
and
he
looked
as
if
fearful
of
his
reception
and
conscious
that
he
merited
no
kind
one
mrs
dashwood
however
conforming
as
she
trusted
to
the
wishes
of
that
daughter
by
whom
she
then
meant
in
the
warmth
of
her
heart
to
be
guided
in
every
thing
met
with
a
look
of
forced
complacency
gave
him
her
hand
and
wished
him
joy
he
coloured
and
stammered
out
an
unintelligible
reply
elinor
s
lips
had
moved
with
her
mother
s
and
when
the
moment
of
action
was
over
she
wished
that
she
had
shaken
hands
with
him
too
but
it
was
then
too
late
and
with
a
countenance
meaning
to
be
open
she
sat
down
again
and
talked
of
the
weather
marianne
had
retreated
as
much
as
possible
out
of
sight
to
conceal
her
distress
and
margaret
understanding
some
part
but
not
the
whole
of
the
case
thought
it
incumbent
on
her
to
be
dignified
and
therefore
took
a
seat
as
far
from
him
as
she
could
and
maintained
a
strict
silence
when
elinor
had
ceased
to
rejoice
in
the
dryness
of
the
season
a
very
awful
pause
took
place
it
was
put
an
end
to
by
mrs
dashwood
who
felt
obliged
to
hope
that
he
had
left
mrs
ferrars
very
well
in
a
hurried
manner
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
another
pause
elinor
resolving
to
exert
herself
though
fearing
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
now
said
is
mrs
ferrars
at
longstaple
at
longstaple
he
replied
with
an
air
of
surprise
no
my
mother
is
in
town
i
meant
said
elinor
taking
up
some
work
from
the
table
to
inquire
for
mrs
edward
ferrars
she
dared
not
look
up
but
her
mother
and
marianne
both
turned
their
eyes
on
him
he
coloured
seemed
perplexed
looked
doubtingly
and
after
some
hesitation
said
perhaps
you
mean
my
brother
you
mean
mrs
mrs
robert
ferrars
mrs
robert
ferrars
was
repeated
by
marianne
and
her
mother
in
an
accent
of
the
utmost
amazement
and
though
elinor
could
not
speak
even
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
with
the
same
impatient
wonder
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
walked
to
the
window
apparently
from
not
knowing
what
to
do
took
up
a
pair
of
scissors
that
lay
there
and
while
spoiling
both
them
and
their
sheath
by
cutting
the
latter
to
pieces
as
he
spoke
said
in
a
hurried
voice
perhaps
you
do
not
know
you
may
not
have
heard
that
my
brother
is
lately
married
to
to
the
youngest
to
miss
lucy
steele
his
words
were
echoed
with
unspeakable
astonishment
by
all
but
elinor
who
sat
with
her
head
leaning
over
her
work
in
a
state
of
such
agitation
as
made
her
hardly
know
where
she
was
yes
said
he
they
were
married
last
week
and
are
now
at
dawlish
elinor
could
sit
it
no
longer
she
almost
ran
out
of
the
room
and
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
burst
into
tears
of
joy
which
at
first
she
thought
would
never
cease
edward
who
had
till
then
looked
any
where
rather
than
at
her
saw
her
hurry
away
and
perhaps
saw
or
even
heard
her
emotion
for
immediately
afterwards
he
fell
into
a
reverie
which
no
remarks
no
inquiries
no
affectionate
address
of
mrs
dashwood
could
penetrate
and
at
last
without
saying
a
word
quitted
the
room
and
walked
out
towards
the
village
leaving
the
others
in
the
greatest
astonishment
and
perplexity
on
a
change
in
his
situation
so
wonderful
and
so
sudden
a
perplexity
which
they
had
no
means
of
lessening
but
by
their
own
conjectures
unaccountable
however
as
the
circumstances
of
his
release
might
appear
to
the
whole
family
it
was
certain
that
edward
was
free
and
to
what
purpose
that
freedom
would
be
employed
was
easily
pre
determined
by
all
for
after
experiencing
the
blessings
of
one
imprudent
engagement
contracted
without
his
mother
s
consent
as
he
had
already
done
for
more
than
four
years
nothing
less
could
be
expected
of
him
in
the
failure
of
that
than
the
immediate
contraction
of
another
his
errand
at
barton
in
fact
was
a
simple
one
it
was
only
to
ask
elinor
to
marry
him
and
considering
that
he
was
not
altogether
inexperienced
in
such
a
question
it
might
be
strange
that
he
should
feel
so
uncomfortable
in
the
present
case
as
he
really
did
so
much
in
need
of
encouragement
and
fresh
air
how
soon
he
had
walked
himself
into
the
proper
resolution
however
how
soon
an
opportunity
of
exercising
it
occurred
in
what
manner
he
expressed
himself
and
how
he
was
received
need
not
be
particularly
told
this
only
need
be
said
that
when
they
all
sat
down
to
table
at
four
o
clock
about
three
hours
after
his
arrival
he
had
secured
his
lady
engaged
her
mother
s
consent
and
was
not
only
in
the
rapturous
profession
of
the
lover
but
in
the
reality
of
reason
and
truth
one
of
the
happiest
of
men
his
situation
indeed
was
more
than
commonly
joyful
he
had
more
than
the
ordinary
triumph
of
accepted
love
to
swell
his
heart
and
raise
his
spirits
he
was
released
without
any
reproach
to
himself
from
an
entanglement
which
had
long
formed
his
misery
from
a
woman
whom
he
had
long
ceased
to
love
and
elevated
at
once
to
that
security
with
another
which
he
must
have
thought
of
almost
with
despair
as
soon
as
he
had
learnt
to
consider
it
with
desire
he
was
brought
not
from
doubt
or
suspense
but
from
misery
to
happiness
and
the
change
was
openly
spoken
in
such
a
genuine
flowing
grateful
cheerfulness
as
his
friends
had
never
witnessed
in
him
before
his
heart
was
now
open
to
elinor
all
its
weaknesses
all
its
errors
confessed
and
his
first
boyish
attachment
to
lucy
treated
with
all
the
philosophic
dignity
of
twenty
four
it
was
a
foolish
idle
inclination
on
my
side
said
he
the
consequence
of
ignorance
of
the
world
and
want
of
employment
had
my
mother
given
me
some
active
profession
when
i
was
removed
at
eighteen
from
the
care
of
mr
pratt
i
think
nay
i
am
sure
it
would
never
have
happened
for
though
i
left
longstaple
with
what
i
thought
at
the
time
a
most
unconquerable
preference
for
his
niece
yet
had
i
then
had
any
pursuit
any
object
to
engage
my
time
and
keep
me
at
a
distance
from
her
for
a
few
months
i
should
very
soon
have
outgrown
the
fancied
attachment
especially
by
mixing
more
with
the
world
as
in
such
case
i
must
have
done
but
instead
of
having
any
thing
to
do
instead
of
having
any
profession
chosen
for
me
or
being
allowed
to
chuse
any
myself
i
returned
home
to
be
completely
idle
and
for
the
first
twelvemonth
afterwards
i
had
not
even
the
nominal
employment
which
belonging
to
the
university
would
have
given
me
for
i
was
not
entered
at
oxford
till
i
was
nineteen
i
had
therefore
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
but
to
fancy
myself
in
love
and
as
my
mother
did
not
make
my
home
in
every
respect
comfortable
as
i
had
no
friend
no
companion
in
my
brother
and
disliked
new
acquaintance
it
was
not
unnatural
for
me
to
be
very
often
at
longstaple
where
i
always
felt
myself
at
home
and
was
always
sure
of
a
welcome
and
accordingly
i
spent
the
greatest
part
of
my
time
there
from
eighteen
to
nineteen
lucy
appeared
everything
that
was
amiable
and
obliging
she
was
pretty
too
at
least
i
thought
so
then
and
i
had
seen
so
little
of
other
women
that
i
could
make
no
comparisons
and
see
no
defects
considering
everything
therefore
i
hope
foolish
as
our
engagement
was
foolish
as
it
has
since
in
every
way
been
proved
it
was
not
at
the
time
an
unnatural
or
an
inexcusable
piece
of
folly
the
change
which
a
few
hours
had
wrought
in
the
minds
and
the
happiness
of
the
dashwoods
was
such
so
great
as
promised
them
all
the
satisfaction
of
a
sleepless
night
mrs
dashwood
too
happy
to
be
comfortable
knew
not
how
to
love
edward
nor
praise
elinor
enough
how
to
be
enough
thankful
for
his
release
without
wounding
his
delicacy
nor
how
at
once
to
give
them
leisure
for
unrestrained
conversation
together
and
yet
enjoy
as
she
wished
the
sight
and
society
of
both
marianne
could
speak
her
happiness
only
by
tears
comparisons
would
occur
regrets
would
arise
and
her
joy
though
sincere
as
her
love
for
her
sister
was
of
a
kind
to
give
her
neither
spirits
nor
language
but
elinor
how
are
her
feelings
to
be
described
from
the
moment
of
learning
that
lucy
was
married
to
another
that
edward
was
free
to
the
moment
of
his
justifying
the
hopes
which
had
so
instantly
followed
she
was
every
thing
by
turns
but
tranquil
but
when
the
second
moment
had
passed
when
she
found
every
doubt
every
solicitude
removed
compared
her
situation
with
what
so
lately
it
had
been
saw
him
honourably
released
from
his
former
engagement
saw
him
instantly
profiting
by
the
release
to
address
herself
and
declare
an
affection
as
tender
as
constant
as
she
had
ever
supposed
it
to
be
she
was
oppressed
she
was
overcome
by
her
own
felicity
and
happily
disposed
as
is
the
human
mind
to
be
easily
familiarized
with
any
change
for
the
better
it
required
several
hours
to
give
sedateness
to
her
spirits
or
any
degree
of
tranquillity
to
her
heart
edward
was
now
fixed
at
the
cottage
at
least
for
a
week
for
whatever
other
claims
might
be
made
on
him
it
was
impossible
that
less
than
a
week
should
be
given
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
elinor
s
company
or
suffice
to
say
half
that
was
to
be
said
of
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
for
though
a
very
few
hours
spent
in
the
hard
labor
of
incessant
talking
will
despatch
more
subjects
than
can
really
be
in
common
between
any
two
rational
creatures
yet
with
lovers
it
is
different
between
them
no
subject
is
finished
no
communication
is
even
made
till
it
has
been
made
at
least
twenty
times
over
lucy
s
marriage
the
unceasing
and
reasonable
wonder
among
them
all
formed
of
course
one
of
the
earliest
discussions
of
the
lovers
and
elinor
s
particular
knowledge
of
each
party
made
it
appear
to
her
in
every
view
as
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
and
unaccountable
circumstances
she
had
ever
heard
how
they
could
be
thrown
together
and
by
what
attraction
robert
could
be
drawn
on
to
marry
a
girl
of
whose
beauty
she
had
herself
heard
him
speak
without
any
admiration
a
girl
too
already
engaged
to
his
brother
and
on
whose
account
that
brother
had
been
thrown
off
by
his
family
it
was
beyond
her
comprehension
to
make
out
to
her
own
heart
it
was
a
delightful
affair
to
her
imagination
it
was
even
a
ridiculous
one
but
to
her
reason
her
judgment
it
was
completely
a
puzzle
edward
could
only
attempt
an
explanation
by
supposing
that
perhaps
at
first
accidentally
meeting
the
vanity
of
the
one
had
been
so
worked
on
by
the
flattery
of
the
other
as
to
lead
by
degrees
to
all
the
rest
elinor
remembered
what
robert
had
told
her
in
harley
street
of
his
opinion
of
what
his
own
mediation
in
his
brother
s
affairs
might
have
done
if
applied
to
in
time
she
repeated
it
to
edward
that
was
exactly
like
robert
was
his
immediate
observation
and
that
he
presently
added
might
perhaps
be
in
his
head
when
the
acquaintance
between
them
first
began
and
lucy
perhaps
at
first
might
think
only
of
procuring
his
good
offices
in
my
favour
other
designs
might
afterward
arise
how
long
it
had
been
carrying
on
between
them
however
he
was
equally
at
a
loss
with
herself
to
make
out
for
at
oxford
where
he
had
remained
for
choice
ever
since
his
quitting
london
he
had
had
no
means
of
hearing
of
her
but
from
herself
and
her
letters
to
the
very
last
were
neither
less
frequent
nor
less
affectionate
than
usual
not
the
smallest
suspicion
therefore
had
ever
occurred
to
prepare
him
for
what
followed
and
when
at
last
it
burst
on
him
in
a
letter
from
lucy
herself
he
had
been
for
some
time
he
believed
half
stupified
between
the
wonder
the
horror
and
the
joy
of
such
a
deliverance
he
put
the
letter
into
elinor
s
hands
dear
sir
being
very
sure
i
have
long
lost
your
affections
i
have
thought
myself
at
liberty
to
bestow
my
own
on
another
and
have
no
doubt
of
being
as
happy
with
him
as
i
once
used
to
think
i
might
be
with
you
but
i
scorn
to
accept
a
hand
while
the
heart
was
another
s
sincerely
wish
you
happy
in
your
choice
and
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
if
we
are
not
always
good
friends
as
our
near
relationship
now
makes
proper
i
can
safely
say
i
owe
you
no
ill
will
and
am
sure
you
will
be
too
generous
to
do
us
any
ill
offices
your
brother
has
gained
my
affections
entirely
and
as
we
could
not
live
without
one
another
we
are
just
returned
from
the
altar
and
are
now
on
our
way
to
dawlish
for
a
few
weeks
which
place
your
dear
brother
has
great
curiosity
to
see
but
thought
i
would
first
trouble
you
with
these
few
lines
and
shall
always
remain
your
sincere
well
wisher
friend
and
sister
lucy
ferrars
i
have
burnt
all
your
letters
and
will
return
your
picture
the
first
opportunity
please
to
destroy
my
scrawls
but
the
ring
with
my
hair
you
are
very
welcome
to
keep
elinor
read
and
returned
it
without
any
comment
i
will
not
ask
your
opinion
of
it
as
a
composition
said
edward
for
worlds
would
not
i
have
had
a
letter
of
hers
seen
by
you
in
former
days
in
a
sister
it
is
bad
enough
but
in
a
wife
how
i
have
blushed
over
the
pages
of
her
writing
and
i
believe
i
may
say
that
since
the
first
half
year
of
our
foolish
business
this
is
the
only
letter
i
ever
received
from
her
of
which
the
substance
made
me
any
amends
for
the
defect
of
the
style
however
it
may
have
come
about
said
elinor
after
a
pause
they
are
certainly
married
and
your
mother
has
brought
on
herself
a
most
appropriate
punishment
the
independence
she
settled
on
robert
through
resentment
against
you
has
put
it
in
his
power
to
make
his
own
choice
and
she
has
actually
been
bribing
one
son
with
a
thousand
a
year
to
do
the
very
deed
which
she
disinherited
the
other
for
intending
to
do
she
will
hardly
be
less
hurt
i
suppose
by
robert
s
marrying
lucy
than
she
would
have
been
by
your
marrying
her
she
will
be
more
hurt
by
it
for
robert
always
was
her
favourite
she
will
be
more
hurt
by
it
and
on
the
same
principle
will
forgive
him
much
sooner
in
what
state
the
affair
stood
at
present
between
them
edward
knew
not
for
no
communication
with
any
of
his
family
had
yet
been
attempted
by
him
he
had
quitted
oxford
within
four
and
twenty
hours
after
lucy
s
letter
arrived
and
with
only
one
object
before
him
the
nearest
road
to
barton
had
had
no
leisure
to
form
any
scheme
of
conduct
with
which
that
road
did
not
hold
the
most
intimate
connection
he
could
do
nothing
till
he
were
assured
of
his
fate
with
miss
dashwood
and
by
his
rapidity
in
seeking
that
fate
it
is
to
be
supposed
in
spite
of
the
jealousy
with
which
he
had
once
thought
of
colonel
brandon
in
spite
of
the
modesty
with
which
he
rated
his
own
deserts
and
the
politeness
with
which
he
talked
of
his
doubts
he
did
not
upon
the
whole
expect
a
very
cruel
reception
it
was
his
business
however
to
say
that
he
did
and
he
said
it
very
prettily
what
he
might
say
on
the
subject
a
twelvemonth
after
must
be
referred
to
the
imagination
of
husbands
and
wives
that
lucy
had
certainly
meant
to
deceive
to
go
off
with
a
flourish
of
malice
against
him
in
her
message
by
thomas
was
perfectly
clear
to
elinor
and
edward
himself
now
thoroughly
enlightened
on
her
character
had
no
scruple
in
believing
her
capable
of
the
utmost
meanness
of
wanton
ill
nature
though
his
eyes
had
been
long
opened
even
before
his
acquaintance
with
elinor
began
to
her
ignorance
and
a
want
of
liberality
in
some
of
her
opinions
they
had
been
equally
imputed
by
him
to
her
want
of
education
and
till
her
last
letter
reached
him
he
had
always
believed
her
to
be
a
well
disposed
good
hearted
girl
and
thoroughly
attached
to
himself
nothing
but
such
a
persuasion
could
have
prevented
his
putting
an
end
to
an
engagement
which
long
before
the
discovery
of
it
laid
him
open
to
his
mother
s
anger
had
been
a
continual
source
of
disquiet
and
regret
to
him
i
thought
it
my
duty
said
he
independent
of
my
feelings
to
give
her
the
option
of
continuing
the
engagement
or
not
when
i
was
renounced
by
my
mother
and
stood
to
all
appearance
without
a
friend
in
the
world
to
assist
me
in
such
a
situation
as
that
where
there
seemed
nothing
to
tempt
the
avarice
or
the
vanity
of
any
living
creature
how
could
i
suppose
when
she
so
earnestly
so
warmly
insisted
on
sharing
my
fate
whatever
it
might
be
that
any
thing
but
the
most
disinterested
affection
was
her
inducement
and
even
now
i
cannot
comprehend
on
what
motive
she
acted
or
what
fancied
advantage
it
could
be
to
her
to
be
fettered
to
a
man
for
whom
she
had
not
the
smallest
regard
and
who
had
only
two
thousand
pounds
in
the
world
she
could
not
foresee
that
colonel
brandon
would
give
me
a
living
no
but
she
might
suppose
that
something
would
occur
in
your
favour
that
your
own
family
might
in
time
relent
and
at
any
rate
she
lost
nothing
by
continuing
the
engagement
for
she
has
proved
that
it
fettered
neither
her
inclination
nor
her
actions
the
connection
was
certainly
a
respectable
one
and
probably
gained
her
consideration
among
her
friends
and
if
nothing
more
advantageous
occurred
it
would
be
better
for
her
to
marry
you
than
be
single
edward
was
of
course
immediately
convinced
that
nothing
could
have
been
more
natural
than
lucy
s
conduct
nor
more
self
evident
than
the
motive
of
it
elinor
scolded
him
harshly
as
ladies
always
scold
the
imprudence
which
compliments
themselves
for
having
spent
so
much
time
with
them
at
norland
when
he
must
have
felt
his
own
inconstancy
your
behaviour
was
certainly
very
wrong
said
she
because
to
say
nothing
of
my
own
conviction
our
relations
were
all
led
away
by
it
to
fancy
and
expect
what
as
you
were
then
situated
could
never
be
he
could
only
plead
an
ignorance
of
his
own
heart
and
a
mistaken
confidence
in
the
force
of
his
engagement
i
was
simple
enough
to
think
that
because
my
faith
was
plighted
to
another
there
could
be
no
danger
in
my
being
with
you
and
that
the
consciousness
of
my
engagement
was
to
keep
my
heart
as
safe
and
sacred
as
my
honour
i
felt
that
i
admired
you
but
i
told
myself
it
was
only
friendship
and
till
i
began
to
make
comparisons
between
yourself
and
lucy
i
did
not
know
how
far
i
was
got
after
that
i
suppose
i
was
wrong
in
remaining
so
much
in
sussex
and
the
arguments
with
which
i
reconciled
myself
to
the
expediency
of
it
were
no
better
than
these
the
danger
is
my
own
i
am
doing
no
injury
to
anybody
but
myself
elinor
smiled
and
shook
her
head
edward
heard
with
pleasure
of
colonel
brandon
s
being
expected
at
the
cottage
as
he
really
wished
not
only
to
be
better
acquainted
with
him
but
to
have
an
opportunity
of
convincing
him
that
he
no
longer
resented
his
giving
him
the
living
of
delaford
which
at
present
said
he
after
thanks
so
ungraciously
delivered
as
mine
were
on
the
occasion
he
must
think
i
have
never
forgiven
him
for
offering
now
he
felt
astonished
himself
that
he
had
never
yet
been
to
the
place
but
so
little
interest
had
he
taken
in
the
matter
that
he
owed
all
his
knowledge
of
the
house
garden
and
glebe
extent
of
the
parish
condition
of
the
land
and
rate
of
the
tithes
to
elinor
herself
who
had
heard
so
much
of
it
from
colonel
brandon
and
heard
it
with
so
much
attention
as
to
be
entirely
mistress
of
the
subject
one
question
after
this
only
remained
undecided
between
them
one
difficulty
only
was
to
be
overcome
they
were
brought
together
by
mutual
affection
with
the
warmest
approbation
of
their
real
friends
their
intimate
knowledge
of
each
other
seemed
to
make
their
happiness
certain
and
they
only
wanted
something
to
live
upon
edward
had
two
thousand
pounds
and
elinor
one
which
with
delaford
living
was
all
that
they
could
call
their
own
for
it
was
impossible
that
mrs
dashwood
should
advance
anything
and
they
were
neither
of
them
quite
enough
in
love
to
think
that
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
would
supply
them
with
the
comforts
of
life
edward
was
not
entirely
without
hopes
of
some
favourable
change
in
his
mother
towards
him
and
on
that
he
rested
for
the
residue
of
their
income
but
elinor
had
no
such
dependence
for
since
edward
would
still
be
unable
to
marry
miss
morton
and
his
chusing
herself
had
been
spoken
of
in
mrs
ferrars
s
flattering
language
as
only
a
lesser
evil
than
his
chusing
lucy
steele
she
feared
that
robert
s
offence
would
serve
no
other
purpose
than
to
enrich
fanny
about
four
days
after
edward
s
arrival
colonel
brandon
appeared
to
complete
mrs
dashwood
s
satisfaction
and
to
give
her
the
dignity
of
having
for
the
first
time
since
her
living
at
barton
more
company
with
her
than
her
house
would
hold
edward
was
allowed
to
retain
the
privilege
of
first
comer
and
colonel
brandon
therefore
walked
every
night
to
his
old
quarters
at
the
park
from
whence
he
usually
returned
in
the
morning
early
enough
to
interrupt
the
lovers
first
tete
a
tete
before
breakfast
a
three
weeks
residence
at
delaford
where
in
his
evening
hours
at
least
he
had
little
to
do
but
to
calculate
the
disproportion
between
thirty
six
and
seventeen
brought
him
to
barton
in
a
temper
of
mind
which
needed
all
the
improvement
in
marianne
s
looks
all
the
kindness
of
her
welcome
and
all
the
encouragement
of
her
mother
s
language
to
make
it
cheerful
among
such
friends
however
and
such
flattery
he
did
revive
no
rumour
of
lucy
s
marriage
had
yet
reached
him
he
knew
nothing
of
what
had
passed
and
the
first
hours
of
his
visit
were
consequently
spent
in
hearing
and
in
wondering
every
thing
was
explained
to
him
by
mrs
dashwood
and
he
found
fresh
reason
to
rejoice
in
what
he
had
done
for
mr
ferrars
since
eventually
it
promoted
the
interest
of
elinor
it
would
be
needless
to
say
that
the
gentlemen
advanced
in
the
good
opinion
of
each
other
as
they
advanced
in
each
other
s
acquaintance
for
it
could
not
be
otherwise
their
resemblance
in
good
principles
and
good
sense
in
disposition
and
manner
of
thinking
would
probably
have
been
sufficient
to
unite
them
in
friendship
without
any
other
attraction
but
their
being
in
love
with
two
sisters
and
two
sisters
fond
of
each
other
made
that
mutual
regard
inevitable
and
immediate
which
might
otherwise
have
waited
the
effect
of
time
and
judgment
the
letters
from
town
which
a
few
days
before
would
have
made
every
nerve
in
elinor
s
body
thrill
with
transport
now
arrived
to
be
read
with
less
emotion
than
mirth
mrs
jennings
wrote
to
tell
the
wonderful
tale
to
vent
her
honest
indignation
against
the
jilting
girl
and
pour
forth
her
compassion
towards
poor
mr
edward
who
she
was
sure
had
quite
doted
upon
the
worthless
hussy
and
was
now
by
all
accounts
almost
broken
hearted
at
oxford
i
do
think
she
continued
nothing
was
ever
carried
on
so
sly
for
it
was
but
two
days
before
lucy
called
and
sat
a
couple
of
hours
with
me
not
a
soul
suspected
anything
of
the
matter
not
even
nancy
who
poor
soul
came
crying
to
me
the
day
after
in
a
great
fright
for
fear
of
mrs
ferrars
as
well
as
not
knowing
how
to
get
to
plymouth
for
lucy
it
seems
borrowed
all
her
money
before
she
went
off
to
be
married
on
purpose
we
suppose
to
make
a
show
with
and
poor
nancy
had
not
seven
shillings
in
the
world
so
i
was
very
glad
to
give
her
five
guineas
to
take
her
down
to
exeter
where
she
thinks
of
staying
three
or
four
weeks
with
mrs
burgess
in
hopes
as
i
tell
her
to
fall
in
with
the
doctor
again
and
i
must
say
that
lucy
s
crossness
not
to
take
them
along
with
them
in
the
chaise
is
worse
than
all
poor
mr
edward
i
cannot
get
him
out
of
my
head
but
you
must
send
for
him
to
barton
and
miss
marianne
must
try
to
comfort
him
mr
dashwood
s
strains
were
more
solemn
mrs
ferrars
was
the
most
unfortunate
of
women
poor
fanny
had
suffered
agonies
of
sensibility
and
he
considered
the
existence
of
each
under
such
a
blow
with
grateful
wonder
robert
s
offence
was
unpardonable
but
lucy
s
was
infinitely
worse
neither
of
them
were
ever
again
to
be
mentioned
to
mrs
ferrars
and
even
if
she
might
hereafter
be
induced
to
forgive
her
son
his
wife
should
never
be
acknowledged
as
her
daughter
nor
be
permitted
to
appear
in
her
presence
the
secrecy
with
which
everything
had
been
carried
on
between
them
was
rationally
treated
as
enormously
heightening
the
crime
because
had
any
suspicion
of
it
occurred
to
the
others
proper
measures
would
have
been
taken
to
prevent
the
marriage
and
he
called
on
elinor
to
join
with
him
in
regretting
that
lucy
s
engagement
with
edward
had
not
rather
been
fulfilled
than
that
she
should
thus
be
the
means
of
spreading
misery
farther
in
the
family
he
thus
continued
mrs
ferrars
has
never
yet
mentioned
edward
s
name
which
does
not
surprise
us
but
to
our
great
astonishment
not
a
line
has
been
received
from
him
on
the
occasion
perhaps
however
he
is
kept
silent
by
his
fear
of
offending
and
i
shall
therefore
give
him
a
hint
by
a
line
to
oxford
that
his
sister
and
i
both
think
a
letter
of
proper
submission
from
him
addressed
perhaps
to
fanny
and
by
her
shewn
to
her
mother
might
not
be
taken
amiss
for
we
all
know
the
tenderness
of
mrs
ferrars
s
heart
and
that
she
wishes
for
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
on
good
terms
with
her
children
this
paragraph
was
of
some
importance
to
the
prospects
and
conduct
of
edward
it
determined
him
to
attempt
a
reconciliation
though
not
exactly
in
the
manner
pointed
out
by
their
brother
and
sister
a
letter
of
proper
submission
repeated
he
would
they
have
me
beg
my
mother
s
pardon
for
robert
s
ingratitude
to
her
and
breach
of
honour
to
me
i
can
make
no
submission
i
am
grown
neither
humble
nor
penitent
by
what
has
passed
i
am
grown
very
happy
but
that
would
not
interest
i
know
of
no
submission
that
is
proper
for
me
to
make
you
may
certainly
ask
to
be
forgiven
said
elinor
because
you
have
offended
and
i
should
think
you
might
now
venture
so
far
as
to
profess
some
concern
for
having
ever
formed
the
engagement
which
drew
on
you
your
mother
s
anger
he
agreed
that
he
might
and
when
she
has
forgiven
you
perhaps
a
little
humility
may
be
convenient
while
acknowledging
a
second
engagement
almost
as
imprudent
in
her
eyes
as
the
first
he
had
nothing
to
urge
against
it
but
still
resisted
the
idea
of
a
letter
of
proper
submission
and
therefore
to
make
it
easier
to
him
as
he
declared
a
much
greater
willingness
to
make
mean
concessions
by
word
of
mouth
than
on
paper
it
was
resolved
that
instead
of
writing
to
fanny
he
should
go
to
london
and
personally
intreat
her
good
offices
in
his
favour
and
if
they
really
do
interest
themselves
said
marianne
in
her
new
character
of
candour
in
bringing
about
a
reconciliation
i
shall
think
that
even
john
and
fanny
are
not
entirely
without
merit
after
a
visit
on
colonel
brandon
s
side
of
only
three
or
four
days
the
two
gentlemen
quitted
barton
together
they
were
to
go
immediately
to
delaford
that
edward
might
have
some
personal
knowledge
of
his
future
home
and
assist
his
patron
and
friend
in
deciding
on
what
improvements
were
needed
to
it
and
from
thence
after
staying
there
a
couple
of
nights
he
was
to
proceed
on
his
journey
to
town
after
a
proper
resistance
on
the
part
of
mrs
ferrars
just
so
violent
and
so
steady
as
to
preserve
her
from
that
reproach
which
she
always
seemed
fearful
of
incurring
the
reproach
of
being
too
amiable
edward
was
admitted
to
her
presence
and
pronounced
to
be
again
her
son
her
family
had
of
late
been
exceedingly
fluctuating
for
many
years
of
her
life
she
had
had
two
sons
but
the
crime
and
annihilation
of
edward
a
few
weeks
ago
had
robbed
her
of
one
the
similar
annihilation
of
robert
had
left
her
for
a
fortnight
without
any
and
now
by
the
resuscitation
of
edward
she
had
one
again
in
spite
of
his
being
allowed
once
more
to
live
however
he
did
not
feel
the
continuance
of
his
existence
secure
till
he
had
revealed
his
present
engagement
for
the
publication
of
that
circumstance
he
feared
might
give
a
sudden
turn
to
his
constitution
and
carry
him
off
as
rapidly
as
before
with
apprehensive
caution
therefore
it
was
revealed
and
he
was
listened
to
with
unexpected
calmness
mrs
ferrars
at
first
reasonably
endeavoured
to
dissuade
him
from
marrying
miss
dashwood
by
every
argument
in
her
power
told
him
that
in
miss
morton
he
would
have
a
woman
of
higher
rank
and
larger
fortune
and
enforced
the
assertion
by
observing
that
miss
morton
was
the
daughter
of
a
nobleman
with
thirty
thousand
pounds
while
miss
dashwood
was
only
the
daughter
of
a
private
gentleman
with
no
more
than
three
but
when
she
found
that
though
perfectly
admitting
the
truth
of
her
representation
he
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
be
guided
by
it
she
judged
it
wisest
from
the
experience
of
the
past
to
submit
and
therefore
after
such
an
ungracious
delay
as
she
owed
to
her
own
dignity
and
as
served
to
prevent
every
suspicion
of
good
will
she
issued
her
decree
of
consent
to
the
marriage
of
edward
and
elinor
what
she
would
engage
to
do
towards
augmenting
their
income
was
next
to
be
considered
and
here
it
plainly
appeared
that
though
edward
was
now
her
only
son
he
was
by
no
means
her
eldest
for
while
robert
was
inevitably
endowed
with
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
not
the
smallest
objection
was
made
against
edward
s
taking
orders
for
the
sake
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
at
the
utmost
nor
was
anything
promised
either
for
the
present
or
in
future
beyond
the
ten
thousand
pounds
which
had
been
given
with
fanny
it
was
as
much
however
as
was
desired
and
more
than
was
expected
by
edward
and
elinor
and
mrs
ferrars
herself
by
her
shuffling
excuses
seemed
the
only
person
surprised
at
her
not
giving
more
with
an
income
quite
sufficient
to
their
wants
thus
secured
to
them
they
had
nothing
to
wait
for
after
edward
was
in
possession
of
the
living
but
the
readiness
of
the
house
to
which
colonel
brandon
with
an
eager
desire
for
the
accommodation
of
elinor
was
making
considerable
improvements
and
after
waiting
some
time
for
their
completion
after
experiencing
as
usual
a
thousand
disappointments
and
delays
from
the
unaccountable
dilatoriness
of
the
workmen
elinor
as
usual
broke
through
the
first
positive
resolution
of
not
marrying
till
every
thing
was
ready
and
the
ceremony
took
place
in
barton
church
early
in
the
autumn
the
first
month
after
their
marriage
was
spent
with
their
friend
at
the
mansion
house
from
whence
they
could
superintend
the
progress
of
the
parsonage
and
direct
every
thing
as
they
liked
on
the
spot
could
chuse
papers
project
shrubberies
and
invent
a
sweep
mrs
jennings
s
prophecies
though
rather
jumbled
together
were
chiefly
fulfilled
for
she
was
able
to
visit
edward
and
his
wife
in
their
parsonage
by
michaelmas
and
she
found
in
elinor
and
her
husband
as
she
really
believed
one
of
the
happiest
couples
in
the
world
they
had
in
fact
nothing
to
wish
for
but
the
marriage
of
colonel
brandon
and
marianne
and
rather
better
pasturage
for
their
cows
they
were
visited
on
their
first
settling
by
almost
all
their
relations
and
friends
mrs
ferrars
came
to
inspect
the
happiness
which
she
was
almost
ashamed
of
having
authorised
and
even
the
dashwoods
were
at
the
expense
of
a
journey
from
sussex
to
do
them
honour
i
will
not
say
that
i
am
disappointed
my
dear
sister
said
john
as
they
were
walking
together
one
morning
before
the
gates
of
delaford
house
that
would
be
saying
too
much
for
certainly
you
have
been
one
of
the
most
fortunate
young
women
in
the
world
as
it
is
but
i
confess
it
would
give
me
great
pleasure
to
call
colonel
brandon
brother
his
property
here
his
place
his
house
every
thing
is
in
such
respectable
and
excellent
condition
and
his
woods
i
have
not
seen
such
timber
any
where
in
dorsetshire
as
there
is
now
standing
in
delaford
hanger
and
though
perhaps
marianne
may
not
seem
exactly
the
person
to
attract
him
yet
i
think
it
would
altogether
be
advisable
for
you
to
have
them
now
frequently
staying
with
you
for
as
colonel
brandon
seems
a
great
deal
at
home
nobody
can
tell
what
may
happen
for
when
people
are
much
thrown
together
and
see
little
of
anybody
else
and
it
will
always
be
in
your
power
to
set
her
off
to
advantage
and
so
forth
in
short
you
may
as
well
give
her
a
chance
you
understand
me
but
though
mrs
ferrars
did
come
to
see
them
and
always
treated
them
with
the
make
believe
of
decent
affection
they
were
never
insulted
by
her
real
favour
and
preference
that
was
due
to
the
folly
of
robert
and
the
cunning
of
his
wife
and
it
was
earned
by
them
before
many
months
had
passed
away
the
selfish
sagacity
of
the
latter
which
had
at
first
drawn
robert
into
the
scrape
was
the
principal
instrument
of
his
deliverance
from
it
for
her
respectful
humility
assiduous
attentions
and
endless
flatteries
as
soon
as
the
smallest
opening
was
given
for
their
exercise
reconciled
mrs
ferrars
to
his
choice
and
re
established
him
completely
in
her
favour
the
whole
of
lucy
s
behaviour
in
the
affair
and
the
prosperity
which
crowned
it
therefore
may
be
held
forth
as
a
most
encouraging
instance
of
what
an
earnest
an
unceasing
attention
to
self
interest
however
its
progress
may
be
apparently
obstructed
will
do
in
securing
every
advantage
of
fortune
with
no
other
sacrifice
than
that
of
time
and
conscience
when
robert
first
sought
her
acquaintance
and
privately
visited
her
in
bartlett
s
buildings
it
was
only
with
the
view
imputed
to
him
by
his
brother
he
merely
meant
to
persuade
her
to
give
up
the
engagement
and
as
there
could
be
nothing
to
overcome
but
the
affection
of
both
he
naturally
expected
that
one
or
two
interviews
would
settle
the
matter
in
that
point
however
and
that
only
he
erred
for
though
lucy
soon
gave
him
hopes
that
his
eloquence
would
convince
her
in
time
another
visit
another
conversation
was
always
wanted
to
produce
this
conviction
some
doubts
always
lingered
in
her
mind
when
they
parted
which
could
only
be
removed
by
another
half
hour
s
discourse
with
himself
his
attendance
was
by
this
means
secured
and
the
rest
followed
in
course
instead
of
talking
of
edward
they
came
gradually
to
talk
only
of
robert
a
subject
on
which
he
had
always
more
to
say
than
on
any
other
and
in
which
she
soon
betrayed
an
interest
even
equal
to
his
own
and
in
short
it
became
speedily
evident
to
both
that
he
had
entirely
supplanted
his
brother
he
was
proud
of
his
conquest
proud
of
tricking
edward
and
very
proud
of
marrying
privately
without
his
mother
s
consent
what
immediately
followed
is
known
they
passed
some
months
in
great
happiness
at
dawlish
for
she
had
many
relations
and
old
acquaintances
to
cut
and
he
drew
several
plans
for
magnificent
cottages
and
from
thence
returning
to
town
procured
the
forgiveness
of
mrs
ferrars
by
the
simple
expedient
of
asking
it
which
at
lucy
s
instigation
was
adopted
the
forgiveness
at
first
indeed
as
was
reasonable
comprehended
only
robert
and
lucy
who
had
owed
his
mother
no
duty
and
therefore
could
have
transgressed
none
still
remained
some
weeks
longer
unpardoned
but
perseverance
in
humility
of
conduct
and
messages
in
self
condemnation
for
robert
s
offence
and
gratitude
for
the
unkindness
she
was
treated
with
procured
her
in
time
the
haughty
notice
which
overcame
her
by
its
graciousness
and
led
soon
afterwards
by
rapid
degrees
to
the
highest
state
of
affection
and
influence
lucy
became
as
necessary
to
mrs
ferrars
as
either
robert
or
fanny
and
while
edward
was
never
cordially
forgiven
for
having
once
intended
to
marry
her
and
elinor
though
superior
to
her
in
fortune
and
birth
was
spoken
of
as
an
intruder
she
was
in
every
thing
considered
and
always
openly
acknowledged
to
be
a
favourite
child
they
settled
in
town
received
very
liberal
assistance
from
mrs
ferrars
were
on
the
best
terms
imaginable
with
the
dashwoods
and
setting
aside
the
jealousies
and
ill
will
continually
subsisting
between
fanny
and
lucy
in
which
their
husbands
of
course
took
a
part
as
well
as
the
frequent
domestic
disagreements
between
robert
and
lucy
themselves
nothing
could
exceed
the
harmony
in
which
they
all
lived
together
what
edward
had
done
to
forfeit
the
right
of
eldest
son
might
have
puzzled
many
people
to
find
out
and
what
robert
had
done
to
succeed
to
it
might
have
puzzled
them
still
more
it
was
an
arrangement
however
justified
in
its
effects
if
not
in
its
cause
for
nothing
ever
appeared
in
robert
s
style
of
living
or
of
talking
to
give
a
suspicion
of
his
regretting
the
extent
of
his
income
as
either
leaving
his
brother
too
little
or
bringing
himself
too
much
and
if
edward
might
be
judged
from
the
ready
discharge
of
his
duties
in
every
particular
from
an
increasing
attachment
to
his
wife
and
his
home
and
from
the
regular
cheerfulness
of
his
spirits
he
might
be
supposed
no
less
contented
with
his
lot
no
less
free
from
every
wish
of
an
exchange
elinor
s
marriage
divided
her
as
little
from
her
family
as
could
well
be
contrived
without
rendering
the
cottage
at
barton
entirely
useless
for
her
mother
and
sisters
spent
much
more
than
half
their
time
with
her
mrs
dashwood
was
acting
on
motives
of
policy
as
well
as
pleasure
in
the
frequency
of
her
visits
at
delaford
for
her
wish
of
bringing
marianne
and
colonel
brandon
together
was
hardly
less
earnest
though
rather
more
liberal
than
what
john
had
expressed
it
was
now
her
darling
object
precious
as
was
the
company
of
her
daughter
to
her
she
desired
nothing
so
much
as
to
give
up
its
constant
enjoyment
to
her
valued
friend
and
to
see
marianne
settled
at
the
mansion
house
was
equally
the
wish
of
edward
and
elinor
they
each
felt
his
sorrows
and
their
own
obligations
and
marianne
by
general
consent
was
to
be
the
reward
of
all
with
such
a
confederacy
against
her
with
a
knowledge
so
intimate
of
his
goodness
with
a
conviction
of
his
fond
attachment
to
herself
which
at
last
though
long
after
it
was
observable
to
everybody
else
burst
on
her
what
could
she
do
marianne
dashwood
was
born
to
an
extraordinary
fate
she
was
born
to
discover
the
falsehood
of
her
own
opinions
and
to
counteract
by
her
conduct
her
most
favourite
maxims
she
was
born
to
overcome
an
affection
formed
so
late
in
life
as
at
seventeen
and
with
no
sentiment
superior
to
strong
esteem
and
lively
friendship
voluntarily
to
give
her
hand
to
another
and
that
other
a
man
who
had
suffered
no
less
than
herself
under
the
event
of
a
former
attachment
whom
two
years
before
she
had
considered
too
old
to
be
married
and
who
still
sought
the
constitutional
safeguard
of
a
flannel
waistcoat
but
so
it
was
instead
of
falling
a
sacrifice
to
an
irresistible
passion
as
once
she
had
fondly
flattered
herself
with
expecting
instead
of
remaining
even
for
ever
with
her
mother
and
finding
her
only
pleasures
in
retirement
and
study
as
afterwards
in
her
more
calm
and
sober
judgment
she
had
determined
on
she
found
herself
at
nineteen
submitting
to
new
attachments
entering
on
new
duties
placed
in
a
new
home
a
wife
the
mistress
of
a
family
and
the
patroness
of
a
village
colonel
brandon
was
now
as
happy
as
all
those
who
best
loved
him
believed
he
deserved
to
be
in
marianne
he
was
consoled
for
every
past
affliction
her
regard
and
her
society
restored
his
mind
to
animation
and
his
spirits
to
cheerfulness
and
that
marianne
found
her
own
happiness
in
forming
his
was
equally
the
persuasion
and
delight
of
each
observing
friend
marianne
could
never
love
by
halves
and
her
whole
heart
became
in
time
as
much
devoted
to
her
husband
as
it
had
once
been
to
willoughby
willoughby
could
not
hear
of
her
marriage
without
a
pang
and
his
punishment
was
soon
afterwards
complete
in
the
voluntary
forgiveness
of
mrs
smith
who
by
stating
his
marriage
with
a
woman
of
character
as
the
source
of
her
clemency
gave
him
reason
for
believing
that
had
he
behaved
with
honour
towards
marianne
he
might
at
once
have
been
happy
and
rich
that
his
repentance
of
misconduct
which
thus
brought
its
own
punishment
was
sincere
need
not
be
doubted
nor
that
he
long
thought
of
colonel
brandon
with
envy
and
of
marianne
with
regret
but
that
he
was
for
ever
inconsolable
that
he
fled
from
society
or
contracted
an
habitual
gloom
of
temper
or
died
of
a
broken
heart
must
not
be
depended
on
for
he
did
neither
he
lived
to
exert
and
frequently
to
enjoy
himself
his
wife
was
not
always
out
of
humour
nor
his
home
always
uncomfortable
and
in
his
breed
of
horses
and
dogs
and
in
sporting
of
every
kind
he
found
no
inconsiderable
degree
of
domestic
felicity
for
marianne
however
in
spite
of
his
incivility
in
surviving
her
loss
he
always
retained
that
decided
regard
which
interested
him
in
every
thing
that
befell
her
and
made
her
his
secret
standard
of
perfection
in
woman
and
many
a
rising
beauty
would
be
slighted
by
him
in
after
days
as
bearing
no
comparison
with
mrs
brandon
mrs
dashwood
was
prudent
enough
to
remain
at
the
cottage
without
attempting
a
removal
to
delaford
and
fortunately
for
sir
john
and
mrs
jennings
when
marianne
was
taken
from
them
margaret
had
reached
an
age
highly
suitable
for
dancing
and
not
very
ineligible
for
being
supposed
to
have
a
lover
between
barton
and
delaford
there
was
that
constant
communication
which
strong
family
affection
would
naturally
dictate
and
among
the
merits
and
the
happiness
of
elinor
and
marianne
let
it
not
be
ranked
as
the
least
considerable
that
though
sisters
and
living
almost
within
sight
of
each
other
they
could
live
without
disagreement
between
themselves
or
producing
coolness
between
their
husbands
the
end
